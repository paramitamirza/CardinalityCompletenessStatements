Lau Wah-sum, OBE, GBS JP (born 30 January 1928) is a member of the Liberal Party and was the unofficial member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (1991â€”95).

He is a registered investment adviser, fellow of Hong Kong Society of Accountants (FHKSA) and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (FCMA). 

In 1989, he said the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China should be disbanded for the sake of Hong Kong as it was considered by China as an anti-China organisation; and that Hong Kong people should exercise self-restraint when criticizing China as Hong Kong was small and China was big.
