Simon Alexander Fraser (13 February 184517 April 1934) was an Australian bagpiper, stockman, and whip-maker of Scottish descent.

Early life

Fraser was born on a boat in Australia, circa February 1845, the eldest of twelve children. Fraser's father was Hugh Archibald Fraser, a Scottish emigrant of Australia in 1828. There, he first lived at River Hunter Valley. Working as a farmer, he lost most of his money within fifteen years, owing to bad crops, and heavy partying and betting. It is claimed that Hugh had relations with Campbell of Lorn. Fraser's mother, Mary Fraser (n√©e Anderson) was bagpiper Charles MacArthur's granddaughter.

Career and personal life

Fraser married Florence MacMillan in 1872. They had five children, two of whom grew up to become successful bagpipers. Fraser did not pursue serious bagpiping until the age 40. He was an entourage of bagpiper Peter Bruce; they had a close relationship, and Bruce left Fraser his pipes in his will. In addition to the bagpipes, Fraser could play the violin and the flute. Fraser also worked as a stock rider and a whipmaker.
