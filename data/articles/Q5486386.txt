From 1980 to 1981 he was Director of the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, with the personal rank of Ambassador.

From 1998 to 2001 he was Under Secretary for Global Affairs. His portfolio included human rights, the promotion of democracy, international criminal activity and narcotics, refugees and population affairs, and environmental matters. He served as chief U.S negotiator for climate change.
