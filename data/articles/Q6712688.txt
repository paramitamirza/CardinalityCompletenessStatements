M. J. Nolan (born 25 January 1951) is a former Irish Fianna Fáil politician. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency from 1982 to 1997 and 2002 to 2011.

Nolan was born in Muine Bheag, County Carlow and educated at De La Salle school, Muine Bheag and Mount St. Joseph's in Roscrea, County Tipperary.

He also served on Carlow County Council from 1979 until 2003, and in May 1982 he was nominated by the Taoiseach, Charles Haughey to the 16th Seanad.

Nolan, the son of the former cabinet minister Tom Nolan, was first elected as a Fianna Fáil TD for the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency at the November 1982 general election. In 1991 he was one of a "gang of four" including Noel Dempsey, Liam Fitzgerald and Seán Power who tabled a motion of no confidence against Charles Haughey as Taoiseach and party leader. Nolan lost his seat at the 1997 general election to constituency colleague John J. McGuinness. He was elected to the 21st Seanad on the Agricultural Panel at a by-election in December 2001.

He regained his Dáil seat at the 2002 general election and was re-elected at the 2007 general election. Nolan was joined in the 30th Dáil by fellow Carlow TD Mary White of the Green Party.
