Crough was the youngest of eight siblings born to an Irish-American family. Her parents, Joseph Wilfred Crough (1919-1987) and Anne (n√©e O'Malley) Crough (1922-2006), and elder siblings, Mrs. Kathleen Galaise (1948-2009) and Patrick Thomas Crough (1956-1993), all predeceased her.

Career

On The Partridge Family, Crough played Tracy Partridge, the youngest Partridge sibling, who played the tambourine. After The Partridge Family, she made several TV movies and made guest appearances on television shows, including Mulligan's Stew. Her last credited on-screen role was as Kate in the 1980 TV movie Children of Divorce.

Post-acting life

Crough graduated from Los Angeles Pierce College and until 1993 owned and operated a bookstore. She married William Condray in July 1985; the couple had two daughters.

On March 2, 2010, during a reunion interview with several co-stars from The Partridge Family on The Today Show, she stated she was a manager at an Office Max in Bullhead City, Arizona.

Death

Crough died suddenly at her home in Laughlin, Nevada, on April 27, 2015, at the age of 52. The cause of death was not immediately reported, but Las Vegas police issued a statement that it was due to a "medical episode" and was "not suspicious." 

According to the Clark County, Nevada coroner, Crough's cause of death was arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, a rare form of cardiomyopathy. Several of Crough's Partridge Family co-stars had paid tribute to her, including Shirley Jones and Danny Bonaduce. Bonaduce lamented, "Everyone thought I'd be the first Partridge to go. Sadly it was little Tracy. Suzanne was a wonderful lady and a good mom, She will be missed".
