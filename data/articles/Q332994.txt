He was elected as a councillor in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham in 1982, remaining a councillor until 1986. He contested the Norwood constituency in the London Borough of Lambeth at the 1987 general election but finished in second place some 4,723 votes behind the veteran Labour MP John Fraser (although increasing the Conservative vote).

Member of Parliament

He was elected to the House of Commons for the Buckinghamshire seat of Beaconsfield at the 1997 general election following the retirement of Tim Smith. Grieve was elected with a majority of 13,987 votes and has remained the MP there since, increasing his majority at each successive election. He made his maiden speech on 21 May 1997.

He was a member of both the Environmental Audit and the Statutory Instruments select committees from 1997 to 1999. William Hague promoted him to the frontbench in 1999 when he became a spokesman on Scottish affairs, moving to speak on home affairs as the spokesman on criminal justice following the election of Iain Duncan Smith as the new leader of the Conservative Party in 2001, and was then promoted to be shadow Attorney General by Michael Howard in 2003. He also had responsibility for community cohesion on behalf of the Conservative Party.

In the last Conservative Shadow Cabinet reshuffle before the General Election of 2010, carried out on 19 January 2009, Grieve was moved to become Shadow Justice Secretary, opposite Jack Straw. According to the BBC, Grieve was said to be "very happy with the move" which would suit his talents better.

After the 2010 general election, Grieve was appointed as the new Attorney General. Grieve was one of four members of the cabinet who abstained in the May 2013 Same-Sex Marriage vote. He said that he believed that the Bill had been 'badly conceived'.

Two days later he apologised and said he had not meant to suggest there was a "particular problem in the Pakistani community".
