Esther Streit-Wurzel (אֶסְתֵּר שְטְרייט-ווֹרְצֶל; July 25, 1932 − December 7, 2013) was an Israeli children's author and educator.

Streit-Wurzel was born in Petah Tikva, Central District, in then Mandatory Palestine. She wrote her first book in 1944, aged 12, under the pen name Zvi Hadas as she was too shy to credit herself. She graduated from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1949, aged 17. Apart from writing, she was also an educator.

Esther Streit-Wurzel died following a serious illness on 7 December 2013, aged 81, in Petah Tikva, Central District, Israel. Her funeral took place the next day on 8 December and was attended by thousands. She was survived by her husband and three children.
