Adhuna Bhabani (known by her marriage name Adhuna Akhtar) is a hair stylist and the co-host of B-Blunt, which airs on TLC.

Early life

She was born to Bengali father Dr Ashish Bhabani. As a child Adhuna used to regularly visit a salon with her mother, Ann in United Kingdom. Her mother was very particular about her hair and there was something about the ambiance of that place which made her want to become a hairdresser. She then enrolled for a training course at Worthington Hair, a salon in Northwest England. Adhuna also participated in, and won, the under-21 national junior hairstyling championship when she was just 17.

Work

She first launched her salon, Juice, in 1998 in Mumbai along with her brother and business partner, Osh Bhabani. But they subsequently changed the name to b:blunt.

Bollywood

She made her Bollywood debut as a hairstylist in 2001 with Farhan Akhtar's Dil Chahta Hai. It was a path-breaking film in many ways — including the looks of the actors. It posed huge challenges for her as they had to create special styles for each of the actors — Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna. The film proved to be a major turning point for her business and the hairdressing industry as a whole.<<ref name="telegraph"/>

She also did the hairstyling for the Hrithik Roshan starrer, Lakshya, in 2004. Preity Zinta was given two looks in the film — a long-haired one and a short crop. It was hard since she and her team were working in Ladakh’s extreme conditions. She recalls a harrowing time — the first day of the shoot — when Preity’s wig began to expand due to the wind and temperature. At the end of it, both Preity and she were in tears, but they managed to make the look work somehow.
