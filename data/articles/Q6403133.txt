Khursheed Bano (Punjabi, ) (14 April 1914 - 18 April 2001) often credited as Khursheed or Khurshid was a singer and actress, and a pioneer of the Indian cinema. Her career ran through the 1930s and 1940s, before she migrated to Pakistan in 1948. Making her debut with Laila Majnu (1931), she acted in over thirty films in India. She is best known for her film Tansen (1943) with actor-singer K. L. Saigal, which featured many of her memorable songs.

Early life

She was born Irshad Begum to Ali Baksh and Iqbal Begum in the village of Choonian, in Kasur District, Lahore, Punjab in present day Pakistan. Her younger sister was the famous Indian actress Meena Kumari. 

Career

Migration to Pakistan

Her last film in India was Papeeha Re (1948), which was a great hit, prior to her migration to Pakistan, leaving her mark in the Indian film industry. Khursheed migrated to Pakistan after the independence, with her husband and settled down in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan.

She worked in two films in 1956, Fankar and Mandi. Mandi was notable because of Khursheed and music composer Rafiq Ghaznavi, but because of poor handling of the film, the film was not a success at the box-office. The second film Fankar produced by Robert Malik, a physics teacher at Saint Paul's English High, in Karachi suffered the same fate.

Personal life

Khursheed married her manager Lala Yakub (not to be confused with the actor Yakub), who was a small-time actor with Kardar Productions and member of the Bhati Gate Group, Lahore, Pakistan. Due to personal problems, she divorced Yakub in 1956. She married Yusuf Bhaimia, who was in the shipping business, in 1956. She had three children and had stopped working in films since her last film in 1956.

Death

Khursheed Bano died on 18 April 2001 in Karachi, Pakistan four days after her 87th birthday.
