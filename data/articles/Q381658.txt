Family and early life

Naughten was born in Drum, County Roscommon. He was educated St. Aloysius College, Athlone, University College Dublin and University College Cork where he did a research project in Food Microbiology. His father, Liam Naughten, was also a Fine Gael TD, who served between 1982 and 1989.

Political career

Naughten was elected at a by-election to Seanad Éireann in 1997 to the seat vacant since the death of his father Liam Naughten. At the 1997 general election he was elected to Dáil Éireann for the Longford-Roscommon constituency and was re-elected at the 2002 general election. He was also a member of Roscommon County Council and the Western Health Board from January 1997 to October 2003.

Within his first few weeks in the Dáil he became Fine Gael spokesperson on Youth Affairs, School Transport and Adult Education. Between 2000 and 2001 he served as Opposition spokesperson on Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Although indicating that he might, Naughten declined to stand in the party's leadership election in 2002. He was later appointed spokesperson on Transport. He was party spokesperson on Agriculture from 2004-2007. 

He was re-elected at the 2007 general election for the new constituency of Roscommon-South Leitrim. He was party spokesperson on Immigration and Integration from 2007-2010. In June 2010, he supported Richard Bruton's leadership challenge to Enda Kenny. Following Kenny's victory in a motion of confidence, Naughten was not re-appointed to the front bench. In October 2010, he was appointed as party Deputy spokesperson on Health with special responsibility for Primary Care and Disability.

He was re-elected at the 2011 general election. He voted against the government's decision to close the Roscommon County Hospital emergency department on 6 July 2011. He lost the Fine Gael party whip the following day.  On 13 September 2013, he and six other expellees formed the Reform Alliance, described as a "loose alliance" rather than a political party.
