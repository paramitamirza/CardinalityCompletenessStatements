Biography

Ian Greenberg is a graduate of Harvard Business School's Advanced Management program (which is an intensive course that the student pays to enter). 0Harold Greenberg and his three brothers, Harvey Greenberg, Sidney Greenberg and Ian Greenberg, founded Astral Media, Inc. in 1961. After Harold's death, Ian Greenberg assumed control of the company and gradually transformed the company, which began as a photographic specialty business, into a pure-play media company (in the 1990s), focused on television, radio, out-of-home advertising and digital media properties.

Astral Media had over 2,800 employees in eight Canadian provinces. Under Greenbergâ€™s direction, Astral Media had grown to operate 84 radio stations, 24 pay and specialty television channels and over 9,500 out-of-home advertising faces. The company also operated over 100 websites. 

Since he was assumed the position of President and CEO, the company has recorded 15 consecutive years of growth.

On March 16, 2012, Astral Media announced it had signed an agreement to sell the company to BCE, Inc (Bell Canada). On October 18, 2012 the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) denied BCE's bid to acquire Astral.

Marriage, children and family

Upon the founding of Astral, Harold Greenberg and his three brothers, including Ian, split a set of what has come to be known as "special shares" amongst themselves and subsequently their respective families (held by special holdings in each of their families names). These shares played a part in the 2012 denied takeover bid by Bell Media. http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/why-the-bce-deal-is-still-ian-greenbergs-best-option/article4898511/.
