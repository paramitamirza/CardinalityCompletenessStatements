Kari Mäkinen (born 5 January 1955 in Pori, Finland) is the archbishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland. On 11 March 2010 he was elected the 14th Archbishop of Turku and Finland, and he was installed on 6 June 2010. His predecessor was Jukka Paarma. Previously Mäkinen served as vicar of Ulvila and since 2006 as Bishop of Turku. 

History

He graduated as a Bachelor (today Master) of theology in 1979 and licentiate in 1987. After his thesis defence in 1989 he became a Doctor of Theology. He worked in the parishes of Roihuvuori and Lauttasaari, Helsinki in the years 1979-1984. After that he worked in the parishes of Länsi-Pori and Ulvila in 1989-1993. He also worked as a full-time researcher between 1984 and 1989. He was elected as the vicar of Ulvila in 1994, and remained in the position until 2005. During his years a vicar of Ulvila he simultaneously worked as assistant in the Archdiocese of Turku. He has also had several positions of trust in different organisations. In 2010 he was voted the Archbishop of Turku and Finland over his opponent on the second round of voting, Miikka Ruokanen. On 26 March 2013, he was the first Archbishop to voice public support for (civil) same-sex marriage. However he has since moderated his stance.

On October 28 2014, when the Finish Parliament narrowly approved a citizen's initiative to legalize same-sex marriages, Archbishop Kari posted on his Facebook page “I know how much this day means to the rainbow community, their loved ones and many others. I rejoice with my whole heart for them and with them,”. By late the next day, at least 8000 members of the Lutheran Church of Finland had officially resigned from the Church.
