Nadine Morano (; born Nadine Pucelle changed by Presidential Decret of 1976 to Nadine Pugelle, 6 November 1963 in Nancy) is a French politician, a prominent member of the UMP, and then of Les Républicains, the party founded by Nicolas Sarkozy. Her father Michel was a truck driver who died in 2011  and her mother, Monique Generelli, was a switchboard operator, daughter of a Piedmontese mason.

Political career

She was Minister for Apprenticeship and Professional Formation under the Minister of Labour, Employment and Health, Xavier Bertrand. She was previously Secretary of State for Family in the government of François Fillon on 18 March 2008. She was elected to represent the fifth constituency of the Meurthe-et-Moselle départment, centred round Toul. In the 2008 municipal elections she headed a list of candidates but was beaten into third place in the second round of voting, winning only 26.26% of the vote compared to the outgoing mayor's list who led 43.69%. 

During the 2012 legislative election, she was beaten in the second round, defeated with 44.33% by the socialist candidate Dominique Potier. 

She gave her support to Jean-François Copé for the run-off at the leadership of the UMP in 2012 and returned to her post of general delegate, with the fillonist Dominique Bussereau.

In September 2015, Morano declared on national television that "France is a Judeo-Christian country, of white race" This resulted in her removal as head of the Les Républicains (the former UMP) list for the regional elections in Meurthe-et-Moselle.  

Points of view

Morano criticized French gay pride parades, calling them "exhibitionist festivals" filled with "guys in garter belts". 

In 2009, she declared to French media that as a Roman Catholic, she was profoundly shocked by the various pronouncements of Pope Benedict XVI on bioethics, including his rejection of condoms to prevent AIDS and his criticisms of indirect abortion. That same year, Morano became the subject of controversy after she said she wished Muslim banlieue youth would "love France when they live here, to find work and not to speak in slang...They shouldn't put their caps on back to front." SOS Racisme condemned Morano's quote, although she responded saying her words had been taken out of context.

In June 2012 Morano gave an interview to the far-right newspaper Minute and spoke of the "shared values" that her party and the National Front have Later she praised the FN leader Marine Le Pen as having "a lot of talent". Le Pen rejected it, saying that Nadine Morano had become "a symbole of the sarkozysm".
