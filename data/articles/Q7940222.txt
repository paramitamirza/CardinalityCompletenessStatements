Criticism

Bozkır caused controversy in 2014 when he reported during a press conference that Turkey would no longer participate in the Eurovision Song Contest after Conchita Wurst's victory in Eurovision Song Contest 2014 and made statements criticized as homophobic. On September 5 the General Manager of TRT, İbrahim Şahin, officially announced that Turkey would not return to 2015 Eurovision Song Contest in Vienna. Bozkır's comments during the press conference included "Each time I look at the Austrian Wurst who won the Eurovision Song Contest, I say ‘Thankfully, we’re not participating in this contest anymore.'" Despite Bozkır's statements, the state television channel later confirmed that Turkey would return for the 2016 contest.
