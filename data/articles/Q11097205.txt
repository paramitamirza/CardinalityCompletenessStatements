Li Hejun (Simplified Chinese 李河君) (born 1967) is a Chinese businessman, chairman of Hanergy.

Finances

According to Forbes, Li had a net worth of $32.7 billion, as of April 2015. In February 2015, the Hurun Report stated that he is the richest man in China, and 28th richest in the world, with a net worth of $26 billion.

Li holds a 80.79% stake in Hanergy Thin Film Power Group Limited.

It was originally reported that Li, who was China's richest man, saw his net worth drop by US$14 billion on 20 May 2015, when Hanergy Thin Film Power's stock plummeted 47% on the Hong Kong stock market in the final half-hour of trading, before being suspended. At the Hanergy AGM earlier that day, Li was notably absent. 

However, it was later revealed that he had shorted more shares in his own company on 18 May, increasing his short position to 7.71% of the company's stock.

He lives in Beijing, China and is married with one child.
