Gerard Davison (c. 1967 - May 5, 2015) was a commander of the Provisional IRA. He was shot and killed on 5 May 2015.

Davison was quizzed about the murder of Robert McCartney in January 2005. He was released without charge. Davison had been a community worker in the working class Markets area of Belfast.

Death

On 5 May 2015 around 09:00 BST, Davison was shot numerous times at Welsh Street in Belfast. While police do not know who killed him, Kevin McGuigan, a former subordinate of Davison's, was named as the chief suspect after he was also shot dead on 12 August.

On the evening of the killing, The Guardian’s Henry McDonald reported: “Davison is the most senior pro-peace process republican to have been killed since the IRA ceasefire of 1997. Security sources said it was highly unlikely that any Ulster loyalist group was behind the murders, adding that the killers may instead have come from within the nationalist community, possibly from people who had a longstanding grudge against the victim.”
