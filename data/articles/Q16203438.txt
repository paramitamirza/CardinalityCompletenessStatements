Life and career

Born on Staten Island as the youngest of three sons, Steven Matteo earned a B.A. from St. Francis College and a J.D. from Touro Law School. He started in politics by working as Deputy Director of Constituent Services to then-Councilman James Oddo in 2004 and then as Chief of Staff in 2006. 

Matteo was originally going to be a candidate for the seat in 2009 but backed out after the change in the term limits law permitted Oddo to seek a third full term.

New York City Council

Matteo contested a bitter Republican primary for the seat on September 10, 2013, against attorney Lisa Giovinazzo. The party feud led to fissures between Minority Leader James Oddo and Congressman Michael Grimm; the latter was supporting Giovinazzo. The disagreement over the party's nomination in this race led to the resignation of GOP County Chairman and Grimm ally, Robert Scamardella. Ultimately, Matteo won with 55% of the vote.

In the general election, John Mancuso was the nominee of the Democratic Party. Matteo won the general with 62% of the vote. Matteo is currently the Minority Leader of the City Council.
