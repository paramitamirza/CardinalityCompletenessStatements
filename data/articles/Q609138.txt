General Dapčević led the Partisan troops that along with Soviet Red Army under General Vladimir Zhdanov liberated Belgrade on October 20, 1944. In 1953 Dapčević was named Chief of the Yugoslav General Staff, but was demoted as a result of being indirectly involved in the Đilas troubles with the party.

Dapčević died at the age of 86 in his home in Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia.
