 Parker Stevenson (born Richard Stevenson Parker, Jr, on June 4, 1952) is an American television and film actor.

Early life

When Parker Stevenson was five years old his mother, who acted in numerous television commercials, took him to a filming session. This resulted in two small television appearances. Parker's father, an investment advisor, disapproved of the whole business, and although Parker appeared in a few plays at Brooks School he had no intention of becoming an actor.

Career

His first notable screen appearance was a starring role in the 1972 movie A Separate Peace. After graduating from Brooks School and Princeton University, where he studied Architecture, he moved to Hollywood, where he landed a role opposite Sam Elliott in the film Lifeguard.

Stevenson became well known from starring with teen heartthrob Shaun Cassidy in the The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries series (1977-79) on ABC-TV. In 1983, he co-starred in the hit movie Stroker Ace as Burt Reynolds's brash race-car driving nemesis, Aubrey James.

In 1986, Stevenson starred as Billy Hazard in the television miniseries North and South, Book II. He co-starred with his then-wife Kirstie Alley, who portrayed his sister Virgilia Hazard. He starred on the short-lived TV series Probe (1988). He was part of the original cast of Baywatch in the 1989 season, returning for the syndicated 1997 and 1998 seasons. He had a recurring role as a computer tycoon on Melrose Place during the second season. He starred in Legion. In 2014 he had a guest role on the Western/Mystery series Longmire.  His most recent appearance was in the 2015 TV movie His Secret Family.

Stevenson has been a serious photographer since he was young; his work can be found at his photography website ShadowWorks.
