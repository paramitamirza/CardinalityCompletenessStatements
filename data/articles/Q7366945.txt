Biography

Reid was born on July 11, 1963 in Alexandria, Virginia and raised in the Las Vegas area where he attended Ed W. Clark High School. He graduated from Brigham Young University (BYU) with a degree in international relations and Spanish, and then furthered his education in law school, graduating in 1987.

As a teenager, he worked as a sportswriter for the Las Vegas Sun and interviewed Muhammad Ali prior to the boxer’s fight with Larry Holmes in 1980.  Later, he served as a member of the Nevada Taxicab Authority. During the 1990s, he also served as senior vice-president and general counsel for Lady Luck Gaming.

He and his wife Cindy have three children.

Clark County Commission

Reid was elected to the Clark County Commission in 2002. As Chairman of the Commission, he updated the master plans of the county to reduce non-conforming zone changes. Reid was reelected in 2006 with 62 percent of the vote.  In 2008, Reid served as chairman of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign for the state of Nevada and an adviser on Western issues.

2010 Nevada Gubernatorial Race

Reid kicked off his run for Governor of Nevada in Las Vegas on October 15, 2009, with a second event in Reno the following day as part of an effort to gain recognition in Northern Nevada.

Reid campaigned on diversifying Nevada’s economy and promoting alternative energy, both in an effort to create jobs.

Reid has disagreed with his father (Harry Reid) on some issues, including by supporting Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic caucuses when Sen. Harry Reid backed Barack Obama. Clinton won the Nevada caucus. In October 2009 he had a differing opinion of a pair of proposals for rail projects in Nevada.

In June 2010, Reid dropped his last name from the heading of many campaign advertisements. His campaign literature then simply said, "Rory 2010."

Reid was defeated by Brian Sandoval on the November 2, 2010 general election.
