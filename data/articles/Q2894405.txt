Biography

He sat on the Board of Banque de Tunisie. He owns 65% of KoralBlue Airlines. He also owns the Karthago Group, including Karthago Airlines and Kathago Hotels. He became the CEO of Nouvelair in 2008. He was a senior official in the now defunct Constitutional Democratic Rally.

Rumors were widespread about his arrest in Tunisia on January 14, 2011, as he was trying to flee Tunisia and meet with family members in Lyon, France. His house in Sokra, 10 mi away from Tunis, has been looted. He is currently in Montreal, Canada. On January 28, 2011, Canadian foreign affairs minister Lawrence Cannon was quoted as having said that Trabelsi was no longer welcome in Canada and was to be arrested. However, Cannon also went on to say that Trabelsi has applied for refugee status and is therefore entitled to 'due process' under Canadian law, which could take years to settle.
