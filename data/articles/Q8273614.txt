Irina Loghin (born February 19, 1939) is a Romanian singer and politician.

Born in Gura Vitioarei, Prahova County, she had a career as a folk music soloist. She made her radio debut in 1963, and in 1967, began a successful duo with Benone Sinulescu. In the early 1980s, due to a wish expressed by Elena Ceau»ôescu, who was jealous of Loghin's popularity, the latter was forbidden from performing on stage, and was unable to do so until after the Romanian Revolution. She joined the Greater Romania Party in 1998, and in 2000, she was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for a Dolj County seat. In 2004, she was elected to the Senate for a Giurgiu County seat.

She and her husband Ion Cernea have a son and a daughter.
