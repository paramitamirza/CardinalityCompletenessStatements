Violet Brown (n√©e Mosse; born 10 March 1900) is a Jamaican supercentenarian who is the oldest validated person ever in Jamaica. She is the third-oldest verified living person in the world behind Susannah Mushatt Jones and Emma Morano. Her date of birth has been variously reported as 4 March 1900, 10 March 1900, and 15 March 1900. However, it was officially recognised as 10 March 1900 by the Gerontology Research Group in 2014. Brown was born when Jamaica was a part of the British Empire and is the last living former subject of Queen Victoria.

Brown was one of four children born to John Mosse, a sugar boiler and Elizabeth Riley, the latter of whom died aged 96. She was baptized at the age of 13. She married Augustus Gaynor Brown, with whom she had one daughter.
