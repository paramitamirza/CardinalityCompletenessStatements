Ahmad Abdulal (احمد عبدالعال) (January 22, 1932  -  November 11, 2013) was the first broadcast journalist in Kuwait. He first studied law, but later decided on a television career. His eventual goal was to become well known on television in Kuwait.

Taw Al Layl

In March 2008, Abdulal was interviewed on Al Watan TV's Taw Al Layl. During the interview he talked about his family, including his wife Montaha Shukry, his children Lama and Nabil, and his grandchildren, Omar and Runa Hantash and Ahmad Abdulal. He addressed his feelings about being out of the public eye for the past decade, his thoughts about Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and his disappointment at the treatment he received from his former employer, Kuwait TV.
