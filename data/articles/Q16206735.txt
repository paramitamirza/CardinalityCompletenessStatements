Jennifer Lynn Tosini Wexton (born May 27, 1968) is an American attorney and politician from the Commonwealth of Virginia. She serves in the Virginia Senate representing the 33rd district. She is a member of the Democratic Party.

Career

Wexton is a partner in the law firm The Laurel Brigade Law Group. She has served as a substitute judge in Loudoun County, Virginia, and as an Assistant Commonwealth’s Attorney. Wexton ran for Loudoun County Commonwealth’s Attorney in the 2011 elections, losing to incumbent Jim Plowman.

After Mark Herring, who represented the 33rd district in the Virginia Senate, won the 2013 election to serve as the Attorney General of Virginia, Wexton declared her candidacy in the special election to fill the remainder of his term. In the Democratic Party primary election, Wexton defeated Sheila Olem. She soundly defeated Republican John Whitbeck and moderate-Republican-turned-Independent Joe T. May after May failed to win the Republican primary to Whitbeck.  

Controversy brewed over an campaign ad endorsed by Wexton which was said by her opponents to compare TEA Party activists to rapists, though the campaign denied making any such comparison. 

She was sworn in as Herring's replacement on January 24, 2014.
