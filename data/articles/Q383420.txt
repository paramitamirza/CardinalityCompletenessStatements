Roger Vadim (26 January 1928 - 11 February 2000) was a French screenwriter, film director/and producer, as well as an author and occasional actor.

Early life

Vadim was born as Roger Vladimir Plemiannikov in Paris. His father, Igor Nikolaevich Plemiannikov (), a White Russian military officer and pianist, had emigrated from Ukraine and became a naturalized French citizen, and was a vice consul of France to Egypt, stationed in Alexandria. His mother, Marie-Antoinette (née Ardilouze), was a French actress. Although Vadim lived in luxury in his early youth, the death of his father, when Vadim was nine years old, caused the family to return to France, where his mother found work running a hostel in the French Alps, which was functioning as a way-station for Jews and other fugitives fleeing Nazism.

Vadim studied journalism and writing at the University of Paris, without graduating. At age 19, he became assistant to film director Marc Allégret, whom he met while working at the Theatre Sarah Bernhardt, and for whom he worked on several screenplays.

Romances

Vadim was celebrated for his romances/marriages to beautiful actresses. He lived with Catherine Deneuve, by whom he had a child, Christian Vadim, prior to his marriage to Fonda. He wrote about these in his 1986 book Bardot, Deneuve & Fonda.

He also lived with screenwriter Ann Biderman for several years, announcing their engagement in 1984, but the couple never wed.

In addition to Vadim's theatre and film work, he also wrote several books, including an autobiography, D'une étoile à l'autre (From One Star to the Next).
