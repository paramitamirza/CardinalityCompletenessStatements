Controversy

Winder wrote articles for the Deseret News and KSL.com (the website for KSL-TV) using the citizen-journalist program Deseret Connect, on West Valley City, under the assumed name of Richard Burwash. The name was made up and inspired by his ancestor Richard Winder that lived in Burwash, Sussex, England in the 1500s. Winder quoted himself in the articles and used a photo of a real person, Peter Burwash, a former professional tennis player in his internal profile at the Deseret News. Winder said he wrote the articles because, "he was frustrated that the newspaper had drastically reduced its city government coverage after layoffs last year but not its crime coverage and wanted to try to restore balance."  As a result of his confession, Winder accepted a reprimand by the West Valley City Council, resigned from his job with a public relations firm, and issued a public apology to his constituents.
