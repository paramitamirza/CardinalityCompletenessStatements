Edward Thaddeus "Tad" Foote II (born December 15, 1937) served as the fourth president of the University of Miami from 1981 through 2001.

A graduate of John Burroughs School in St. Louis, Missouri, Yale University, and Georgetown University Law Center. Foote served as dean of the law school at Washington University in St. Louis from 1973 to 1980.

Foote was appointed University of Miami president in March 1981. He was followed in this position by Donna Shalala, who served as Secretary of Health and Human Services under President Bill Clinton.

During his tenure, undergraduate admissions and academic standards were raised, top faculty recruited, and major private and government funding secured for research and permanent facilities. The increase in the University's local, national and international profile paralleled the rise of Miami as the so-called "Capital of the Americas." Foote however, was not held in such high regard by Miami Hurricane football players (along with coach Jimmy Johnson), who felt that Foote never embraced the athletics program, especially the football team, which had exploded in popularity in the 1980s. 

The University of Miami established the Foote Fellowships in honor of the University's fourth president.
