Michael Cathel Fallon MP (born 14 May 1952) is a British Conservative politician and Member of Parliament for Sevenoaks.

Since 2014, he has served as Secretary of State for Defence and been a member of the National Security Council. He was previously Vice Chairman of the Conservative Party.

Early life

Fallon, the son of surgeon Martin Fallon OBE, was educated at Craigflower Preparatory School near Dunfermline and at Epsom College, an independent boys' school in Surrey. He then went to the University of St Andrews, where he read Classics and Ancient History, graduating in 1974 with a Master of Arts (MA) degree.

Political career

As a student, Fallon was active in the European Movement and the "Yes" youth campaign in the 1975 referendum. After university he joined the Conservative Research Department, working first for Lord Carrington in the House of Lords until 1977 and then as European Desk Officer until 1979. In 1979 he became Research Assistant to former MEP, Baroness Elles.

In July 1982 he was selected as the Conservative Parliamentary Candidate for Darlington to fight the Darlington by-election on 24 March 1983, following the death of Labour MP Ted Fletcher. Although he lost to Labour's Ossie O'Brien by some 2,412 votes, just 77 days later he defeated O'Brien by 3,438 votes in the June 1983 general election. He remained MP for Darlington until the 1992 General Election when he was defeated by Labour's Alan Milburn by a margin of 2,798 votes.

He re-entered Parliament at the 1997 general election representing the safe Conservative constituency of Sevenoaks following the retirement of the sitting Tory MP, Mark Wolfson, and has served as the MP there since.

Parliamentary career

In parliament Michael Fallon was appointed as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Energy Cecil Parkinson following the 1987 General Election, and in 1988 joined the government of Margaret Thatcher as an Assistant Whip, becoming a Lord Commissioner to the Treasury in 1990.

Mrs Thatcher appointed him Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the Department for Education and Science in July 1990 a position he continued to hold under the new premiership of John Major. He remained in that office until his 1992-General Election defeat.

Between 1992-97, Fallon set up a chain of children’s nurseries called Just Learning with funding from Dragons' Den (UK) star Duncan Bannatyne, where he became chief executive.

Following his return to Parliament at the 1997 General Election he was appointed Opposition Spokesman for Trade and Industry and then Shadow Financial Secretary to the Treasury, but he resigned from the front-bench owing to ill-health in October 1998, and remained on the backbenches until his promotion as Deputy Chairman of the Party.

From 1999 he was a member of the Treasury Select Committee, and chairman of its Sub-Committee (2001-10). He also served as a 1922 Committee executive between 2005-07.

In September 2012, he was sworn of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, upon his appointment as Minister for Business and Enterprise.

Fallon has been a director at Tullett Prebon, a leading brokerage firm in the City of London, and one of the biggest supporters of the privatisation of Royal Mail.

In January 2014 Fallon was appointed Minister for Portsmouth, subsequently being promoted to the Cabinet, on 15 July 2014, as Secretary of State for Defence.

===Run-up to the 2015 general election=== During the run-up to the 2015 general election Fallon wrote an article in The Times saying that Ed Miliband had stabbed his brother in the back to become Labour leader and he would also stab the UK in the back to become prime minister. Fallon subsequently declined the opportunity to describe Miliband as a decent person and his comments embarrassed Conservative supporters. Miliband's response saying that Fallon had fallen below his usual standards and demeaned himself were seen by the New Statesman as dignified, contrasting with Fallon's counter-productive personal attack.

An Election Communication posted to his constituents states that Fallon "has taken a close interest in family issues, voting against gay marriage and supporting parental responsibility. He works closely with local churches when moral matters come before Parliament."

Expenses scandal

According to the Daily Telegraph, Fallon, Deputy Chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, claimed for mortgage repayments on his Westminster flat in their entirety. MPs are only allowed to claim for interest charges.

Between 2002 and 2004, Fallon regularly claimed £1,255 per month in capital repayments and interest, rather than the £700-£800 for the interest-component alone. After his error was noticed by staff at the Commons Fees Office in September 2004, he asked: "Why has no one brought this to my attention before?"  He repaid £2,200 of this over-claim, but was allowed to offset the remaining £6,100 against his allowance. After realising they had failed to notice the excessive claims, Commons staff reportedly suggested Fallon submit fresh claims which would "reassign" the surplus payments to other costs he had legitimately incurred.

Personal life

Fallon has been married to Wendy Elisabeth Payne since 1986 and they have two sons. The family lives in Sundridge, Kent. While he was out of Parliament he was a director of Quality Care Homes plc and other companies founded by Dragon's Den star Duncan Bannatyne.

He was banned from driving for 18 months in 1983 after admitting a drink driving offence during the general election campaign.
