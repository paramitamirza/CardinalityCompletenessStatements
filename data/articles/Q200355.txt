Olivia Wilde (born Olivia Jane Cockburn; March 10, 1984) is an American-Irish actress, producer and activist. She is well known for her television role as Dr. Remy "Thirteen" Hadley on House (2007-12), and for her roles in Tron: Legacy (2010), Her (2013), Drinking Buddies (2013), Rush (2013) and her upcoming role in HBO's rock 'n' roll drama, Vinyl (2016).

Early life

Wilde was born in New York City. Her mother, Leslie Cockburn (n√©e Leslie Corkill Redlich), is an American-born 60 Minutes producer and journalist. Her father, Andrew Cockburn, also a journalist, was born in London, to British parents, and was raised in Ireland. Her uncles, Alexander Cockburn and Patrick Cockburn, also worked as journalists. Wilde's older sister, Chloe Cockburn, is a civil rights attorney in New York. Her aunt, Sarah Caudwell, was a writer; her half-cousin, Stephanie Flanders, is a journalist; and her paternal grandfather, Claud Cockburn, was a novelist and journalist.

Wilde's father's upper-class English ancestors lived in several places at the height of the British Empire, including Peking (where her paternal grandfather was born), Calcutta, Bombay, Cairo, and Tasmania (one of her paternal great-great-grandfathers, Henry Arthur Blake, was Governor of Hong Kong). Wilde's father's ancestors include abolitionist and Anglican minister James Ramsay, politician George Arbuthnot, lawyer, judge, and literary figure Henry Cockburn, Lord Cockburn, Lord Provost of Edinburgh Sir William Arbuthnot, and Sir Thomas Osborne. Wilde's ancestry includes English, Irish, Scottish, Manx, and German; she is also of 1/64th Sephardi Jewish descent (from Spain and Portugal) through Ralph Bernal (1783-1854), a Jewish British Whig politician and actor.

Wilde has said that as a result of her parents' occupations, she has a "strong journalistic streak," being "really critical and analytical".  Both her parents were prominent in the Washington, D.C. social scene, hosting dinner parties. Her mother once recounted a story of a four-year-old Wilde eavesdropping one night on a conversation between diplomat Richard Holbrooke and singer Mick Jagger, until Jagger noticed her and shooed her to bed. She has wanted to become an actress since the age of two. For a short time, Wilde's family had a house in Guilford, Vermont. She attended Georgetown Day School in Washington, D.C., as well as Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, graduating in 2002. She also studied acting at the Gaiety School of Acting in Dublin. Wilde had writer Christopher Hitchens as a babysitter.

Personal life

Wilde has dual citizenship in the United States and Ireland. She derived her stage name "Wilde" from Irish author Oscar Wilde. She changed her surname while in high school, to honor the writers in her family, many of whom used pen names. She is a pescetarian, though formerly vegan, and was voted PETA's Sexiest Vegetarian Celebrity of 2010.

Relationships

On June 7, 2003, when she was 19 years old, Wilde married Tao Ruspoli, an Italian filmmaker and musician, whose family owns a famed palazzo in Italy, at a ceremony in Washington, Virginia. They were married on a school bus with only a pair of witnesses. She later said the marriage occurred in an abandoned school bus because it was the only place where they could be completely alone, as the marriage was a secret at the time. On February 8, 2011, she and Ruspoli announced that they were separating. Wilde filed for divorce in Los Angeles County Superior Court on March 3, 2011, citing "irreconcilable differences". The divorce was finalized on September 29, 2011. Wilde did not seek spousal support, and the pair reached a private agreement on property division.

Wilde began dating actor Jason Sudeikis in November 2011, and they became engaged in January 2013. They have one son, Otis Alexander (born on April 20, 2014).
