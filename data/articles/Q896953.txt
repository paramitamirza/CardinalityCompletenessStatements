Bradford Dillman (born April 14, 1930) is an American actor and author.

Early life

Bradford Dillman was born on April 14, 1930 in San Francisco, California, the son of Josephine (n√©e Moore) and Dean Dillman, a stockbroker. He studied at Town School for Boys and St. Ignatius High School. Later, he attended the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut, where he became involved in school theater productions. He attended Yale University, studying theatre and drama. While at Yale, he enlisted in the U.S. Naval Reserve in 1948. He graduated from Yale with a BA in English Literature.

After graduation, he entered the United States Marine Corps as an officer candidate, training at Parris Island. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps in September 1951. As he was preparing to deploy to Korea, his orders were changed, and he spent the rest of his time in the Marine Corps, 1951 to 1953, teaching communication in the Instructors' Orientation Course. He was discharged in 1953 at the rank of first lieutenant.

Early acting career

Studying with the Actors Studio, he spent several seasons apprenticing with the Sharon, Connecticut Playhouse before making his professional acting debut in The Scarecrow in 1953. Dillman took his initial Broadway bow in the Eugene O'Neill play Long Day's Journey Into Night in 1956, playing the author's alter ego character Edmund Tyrone and winning a Theatre World Award in the process. This distinct success put him squarely on the map and 20th Century Fox took notice by placing the darkly handsome up-and-comer under contract. Cast in the melodramatic soaper A Certain Smile (1958), he earned a Golden Globe award. In 1957, Actress and Producer Katharine Cornell placed him in her Broadway production of Robert E. Sherwood's Pulitzer Prize winning play, There Shall Be No Night. The play was adapted for television in a Hallmark Hall of Fame production.

Film and TV career

After his debut in A Certain Smile, he appeared in many films over the years including Compulsion (1959) for which he won a Cannes Film Festival award, A Circle of Deception (1960), Crack in the Mirror (1960), the title role in Francis of Assisi (1961), A Rage to Live (1965), The Bridge at Remagen,(1969), Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971), The Way We Were (1973), Gold (1974), Bug (1975), The Enforcer (1976), The Swarm (1978), Piranha (1978), Sudden Impact (1983), and Lords of the Deep (1989).

Dillman appeared on television throughout his career, starting on Kraft Television Theatre in 1954. He co-starred with Peter Graves in Court Martial (1966). He guest-starred on such series as Ironside, The Big Valley, Shane, The Name of the Game, Columbo, Wild Wild West The Eleventh Hour, Wagon Train, The Greatest Show on Earth, Breaking Point, Mission Impossible, The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Three for the Road, and a two part episode of The Man From U.N.C.L.E., which was made into the feature film The Helicopter Spies (1968).

He appeared in made-for-TV movies such as Fear No Evil (1969), Moon of the Wolf (1972), and Deliver Us from Evil (1973).

He had a memorable role in The Incredible Hulk episode "The Snare", an homage to the Richard Connell short story "The Most Dangerous Game". His last known acting appearance to date was in an episode of Murder, She Wrote (1995), a series in which he made eight guest appearances in total. He wrote the football fan book, Inside the New York Giants (1995), and an autobiography, Are You Anybody?: An Actor's Life (1997).

Personal life

From 1956-62, Dillman was married to Frieda Harding, and had two children (Jeffrey and Pamela) with her. He met actress and model Suzy Parker during the filming of A Circle of Deception (1960). They were married on April 20, 1963 and had three children, Dinah, Charles, and Christopher. They almost lost Dinah to a snake bite when she was 22 months old. The marriage lasted until her death on May 3, 2003. He lives in Montecito, California.

"Bradford Dillman" is the actor's real name. In The Guinness Book of Movie Facts and Feats, he said that "Bradford Dillman sounded like a distinguished, phony, theatrical name -- so I kept it."
