More recently, he became widely known for television roles, playing Rear Admiral Albert "Al" Calavicci in the 1989-1993 NBC-TV Universal television series Quantum Leap, and Brother Cavil in the Sci Fi Channel 21st-century revival of Battlestar Galactica.

In the early 1960s, Stockwell dropped out of show business, becoming active in the hippie subculture.

The following year, he turned in a brief but significant role as attorney Bob Grimes in William Friedkin's To Live and Die in L.A.. In 1986, Stockwell made an appearance in another Lynch production, the neo-noir thriller Blue Velvet. In 1988, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as Mafia boss Tony "the Tiger" Russo in the comedy Married to the Mob.

Stockwell married Millie Perkins on April 15, 1960; they divorced on July 30, 1962. He married Joy Marchenko on December 15, 1981. They had two children: a son, Austin, born November 5, 1983, and a daughter, Sophia, born August 5, 1985. Stockwell and Marchenko divorced in 2004.

Stockwell has been widely reported to be the godfather of actress Amber Tamblyn; however, in a 2009 interview with Parade, Tamblyn explained that Stockwell was one of three famous friends of her father, actor Russ Tamblyn, who were always around the house when she was growing up, and who were big influences on her life. The other two, in addition to Stockwell, were actor Dennis Hopper, and musician Neil Young. The word "godfather" was "just a loose term Iâ€™ve always used for all of them," Tamblyn explained in the interview.

Stockwell is an accomplished artist who creates both digitally enhanced photographs and original collages in the style of his friend and fellow artist, Wallace Berman. During his time at the University of California, Berkeley, Stockwell immersed himself in music and wrote several small compositions. As part of his friendship with musician Neil Young, Stockwell designed the album cover art for American Stars 'N Bars. Together, they directed Human Highway, which Stockwell also co-wrote. The title track from Young's 1970 album After the Gold Rush is based on the title of a screenplay written by Stockwell.

Stockwell is an avid golfer and played golf during breaks in filming episodes of Quantum Leap. He is a martial artist, holding instructor rank in Modern Arnis.

Stockwell is an "avowed environmentalist", an aspect which has permeated his onscreen characters at times.
