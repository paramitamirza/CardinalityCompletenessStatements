Early life

Sedgwick was born in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, the second of five children born to Henry Dwight Sedgwick II (1824 - 1903) and Henrietta Ellery Sedgwick (1829 - 1899). On his paternal grandmother's side, he was part of the New England Dwight family. His paternal grandfather was Theodore Sedgwick. He had an older sister, Jane Minot (1859-1918), and three younger brothers, Theodore (1863 - 1951), Alexander "Aleck" (1867 - 1929) and Ellery Sedgwick.

Career

Sedgwick graduated from Harvard University in 1882, and studied law in Boston until 1884 when he was admitted to the bar. He practiced law in New York City from 1885 to 1898. He was elected to the National Institute of Arts and Letters, and was elected in 1893 as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, whose members were chosen from the National Institute; they have since become one entity. He also was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (Boston) and the Massachusetts Historical Society.

He later became an author and wrote several historical biographies on Isaac Thomas Hecker, Henry of Navarre, Alfred de Musset, and Marcus Aurelius.

Personal life

Marriages and children

On November 8, 1895, Sedgwick married Sarah May Minturn, daughter of Robert Bowne Minturn, Jr. (part owner of the Flying Cloud clipper ship) and Susanna (née Shaw) Minturn (Susanna was the sister of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw) at St. George's Protestant Episcopal Church in New York City. The couple had four children: Henry Dwight "Halla" IV (1896 - 1914), Edith Minturn (1901 - 1901), Robert Minturn (1899 - 1976), and Francis Minturn Sedgwick (1904 - 1967). Their only daughter, Edith, died the day after her birth. Their eldest son Henry IV (known as Halla) died of pneumonia at the age of 17. Sarah May Minturn died of a stroke in 1919.

On May 18, 1953, Sedgwick married Gabriella May Ladd in Newtown Township, Pennsylvania. She was the daughter of Dr. Maynard Ladd and sculptress Anna Coleman Ladd. Ladd, who was 46 years Sedgwick's junior, had never been married nor did she remarry after Sedgwick's death.

Relatives and friends

Sedgwick's paternal granddaughter was Edith Minturn "Edie" Sedgwick, the daughter of his youngest son Francis and his wife Alice Delano de Forest. Alice was the daughter of Henry deForest. During the 1960s, Edie Sedgwick starred in many of Andy Warhol's short films.

He is also a paternal great-grandfather to actress Kyra Sedgwick, whose father is Henry Dwight Sedgwick V. Henry V is the son of Sedgwick's second oldest son Robert and his first wife Helen Peabody (1890 - 1948), daughter of Endicott Peabody.

Sedgwick was a friend to Leavitt Hunt, son of Vermont Congressman Jonathan Hunt (Vermont Representative) and, like Sedgwick, also a Harvard Law School-educated New York attorney. Hunt was also a photographer and brother of Boston painter William Morris Hunt and architect Richard Morris Hunt. Sedgwick and Leavitt Hunt frequently corresponded.
