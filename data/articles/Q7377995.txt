Life

He was born on June 23, 1842 at Hilo and died July 4, 1910 at Hilo. His mother was Sarah Joiner (1805-1885) and father was David Belden Lyman (1803-1883), missionaries in the fifth company from the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.He was the namesake of Rev Rufus Anderson who was foreign secretary of the mission board and visited his parent's mission in 1863. He attended Punahou School from 1856 to 1862 (as would ten of his children).Rufus Lyman married Hualani Ahung (1844-1906) who had a Chinese father and Cherokee-Hawaiian mother. As customary at the time, she also took a Christian first name for her baptism. Her mother, a descendant of King Kūalii of Oahu, remarried Honolulu postmaster Arthur. P. Brickwood, so Hualani's name was anglicized to "Rebecca Brickwood" on official records for their wedding in 1866.Her Hawaiian name comes from hua lani which means "offspring from heaven" in the Hawaiian language.They had fifteen children, many of whom would become influential in different ways.

Inheriting his mother's interest in observing nearby volcanoes, Lyman developed a theory for the formation of lava tree molds discovered on the ranch of fellow missionary son William Herbert Shipman (who also married the daughter of Hawaiian nobility).This area is now Lava Tree State Monument.Rufus Anderson became circuit judge in 1866, lieutenant governor of the island in 1868, and served on several other boards and commissions.While working with the Royal Governor Princess Ruth Keelikōlani, he became her business advisor, helping her build one of the largest land holdings in the islands. He became tax assessor and collected both taxes and rents on the crown lands. He became friends with King Kamehameha V and wrote a short biography of the king.

Planter

In 1878 the family moved to the Hāmākua district and opened the sugarcane plantation in Paauhau. His business partners were Samuel Parker, William G. Irwin, and Claus Spreckels. It was headquartered at coordinates , on a cliff about 300 feet (100m) above the ocean. Fields reached up the slopes of Mauna Kea, with an innovative transportation system. It became one of the first fully irrigated plantations in 1911. A small town for worker housing grew up above the mill. He opened the first post office in Hāmākua and served as its postmaster.  The company was sold to Honokaa Sugar Company in 1972, and it shut down in 1994.

He was called to testify on conditions in Hawaii when a committee of the United States Senate visited Hawaii island after the annexation.
