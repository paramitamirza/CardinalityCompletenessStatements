Keith Faber (born January 19, 1966) is the 94th President of the Ohio Senate and the state Senator for the 12th District. He formerly served in the Ohio House of Representatives. He is a Republican.

Life and career

Faber is the principal partner with Faber and Associates in Celina, a law firm specializing in civil litigation and mediation, helping courts and parties resolve matters without trial. He earned his Juris Doctorate from The Ohio State University in 1991.

With incumbent Jim Buchy unable to run for another term in the House in 2000, Faber sought to replace him. He faced a primary race with fellow Republican Terry Haworth, and won by about 1,300 votes. He defeated Democrat Bill Sell in the general election by about 14,000 votes. He won reelection in 2002, 2004, and 2006.

Ohio Senate

With Jim Jordan vacating the seat after winning a seat in Congress, Faber was one of seven who sought to replace him, along with Derrick Seaver, Gene Krebs, Robert J. Luckey III, Toni Slusser, Vincent Foulk and Kreg Allison. Faber won the support of Senate Republicans, and took the seat in the Senate in February 2007. Soon after the appointment, Senate President Bill Harris appointed Faber to the Senate Finance and Financial Institutions Committee.

For the 128th General Assembly, Faber served as Senate majority floor leader, and in the 129th General Assembly, he served as President pro tempore, the second highest post in the Senate. As President pro tempore, Faber was also vice chairman of the Senate Rules and Reference Committee. Faber won reelection to a second term in 2012, defeating Libertarian Paul Hinds with 79.07% of the vote.

Currently, Faber is serving as the 94th President of the Ohio Senate.
