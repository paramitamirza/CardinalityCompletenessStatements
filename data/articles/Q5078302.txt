Charles Gordon, 10th Marquess of Huntly (4 January 1792 - 18 September 1863), styled Lord Strathavon from 1794 to 1836 and Earl of Aboyne from 1836 to 1853, was a Scottish peer and first a Tory (1818-30) and then a Whig (1830 onwards) politician.

Family

Huntly was the eldest son of the 5th Earl of Aboyne (later Marquess of Huntly) and his wife, Catherine. He was educated at St John's College, Cambridge, and entered Parliament in 1818 as a Tory MP for East Grinstead before being elected as a Whig MP for Huntingdonshire in 1830. From 1826 to 1830, he was a Lord of the Bedchamber and then a Lord-in-Waiting from 1840 to 1841, his last office being that of Lord Lieutenant of Aberdeenshire from 1861 until his death.

On 20 March 1826, Lord Strathavon married Lady Elizabeth Conyngham (the eldest daughter of the 1st Marquess Conyngham). Elizabeth died in 1839 and the by-now Earl of Aboyne married Maria Antoinetta Pegus, a half-sister of George Frederick Albemarle Bertie, 10th Earl of Lindsey, on 10 April 1844; they had fourteen children:
