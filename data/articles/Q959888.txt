Mirza Nasrullah Khan (1840 - 13 September 1907) (Persian: میرزا نصرالله خان نایینی), titled Moshir al-Dowleh, was the first Iranian Prime Minister. He became Iranian Prime Minister following the introduction of the Persian Constitution of 1906, establishing Iran's first legitimate government approved by the Majlis on 7 October 1906. Before becoming Prime Minister, he had served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. He died in circumstances said to be suspicious and was buried in Imamzadeh Saleh of Tajrish.

Early life

Born in 1840 to a family of religious leaders, he grew up in Nain before later travelling to Tehran. In 1862 he married the daughter of wealthy merchant named Mirza Taghi Ajoodan. They had two sons, Hassan and Hossein, who would later draft the Persian Constitution of 1906 and play key roles in Iranian politics during the later Qajar period. Nasrullah, working his way up through the ranks of government, became the Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1898.

Prime Ministership

Nasrullah became the first prime minister of Iran under the new Iranian Constitution of 1906. Although he resigned on 17 March 1907, his cabinet remained in place until 1 May 1907. After Nasrullah's death, his eldest son Hassan Pirnia inherited the title of Moshir al-Dowleh before also serving as Prime Minister the following decade.
