Emina Zečaj (née Ahmedhodžić; born 17 March 1939) is a Bosnian interpreter of the traditional Bosniak folk music, sevdalinka. Professor Cvjetko Rihtman, an ethnomusicologist, discovered her in the early 1960s. Following persuasion from her friends, Emina auditioned before two well known professors, Zvonimir Nevžela and Beluš Jungić, and was accepted into Radio Sarajevo, beating out 30 other contestants.

Zečaj was called an "icon of traditional Bosnian music" by the American Billboard magazine in 2004.

Early life

Emina was born into an ethnic Bosniak and Muslim family near Sarajevo's Old Town. She was the daughter of Avdija Ahmedhodžić and his wife Melća.
