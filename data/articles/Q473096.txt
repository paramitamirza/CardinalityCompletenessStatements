Political life

In 1963, Osmeña was elected as councilor of Cebu City. Two years later, in 1965, he was elected as the city's vice mayor. In 1969, he was elected to the House of Representatives of the Philippines representing Cebu's 2nd District.

In 1970, he was named as one of the Ten Outstanding Young Men of the Philippines.

In 1971, he ran as senator. At the Miting De Avance of the Liberal Party on Plaza Miranda on August 21, 1971, two grenades exploded, killing 11 and leaving several people wounded. Both of Osmeña’s legs were badly injured. He finished third in the senatorial race

When President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law on September 23, 1972, Osmeña went on exile in the United States.

After the assassination of Former Senator Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino on August 21, 1983, he was the among the first political exiles to return to the country to help in the fight against the Marcos dictatorship.

He was appointed officer-in-charge mayor of Cebu City after the 1986 People Power Revolution. He was again elected Senator in 1987 under the Lakas ng Bayan Coalition of President Corazon Aquino.

In 1992, he ran for vice president under the Nationalist People's Coalition with businessman Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr. as his running mate. He soon withdrew his candidacy and was replaced by Senator Joseph Estrada. He instead sought reelection as senator but he only managed to serve for three years only as he finished in the 23rd place since the 12th to 24th placers of that election were entitled to a three (3) year term only. This was a transitory provision in the Constitution intended to synchronize the terms of Senators, ensuring that the Senate becomes a continuous body.

He became the Representative of the 3rd District of Cebu in 1995 before being elected as senator again in 1998.
