Thomas E. Love (born October 1937) is an American entrepreneur. He is the owner, founder and executive chairman of Love's Travel Stops & Country Stores.

Early life

Thomas E. Love was born in Oklahoma City in October 1937, one of six siblings, the son of F. C. Love, a lawyer who was later president of the oil company Kerr-McGee, and Margaret Eugenia Vessels Love.

Aged 13, he left home to be educated as a boarder at St. Gregory's High School in Shawnee, where he was a standout football player.

Love attended St. John's University in St. Cloud, Minnesota, but left after less than one semester. He then joined the US Marine Corps and over a three-year career, rose to the rank of corporal. When he left the Marines, he married and decided to try college once more.  He dropped out of the University of Oklahoma in 1964.

Career

Initially, Love owned restaurants and car washes, until he discovered an opportunity in abandoned gas stations.

In January 1964, Love and his wife Judy leased a self-service gas station in Watonga, Oklahoma. Love went on to open another 30 gas stations. Then in 1971, he decided to merge self-service gas stations with convenience stores, and the business continued to grow.

Today, Love's Travel Stops & Country Stores is a national chain with more than 340 locations in 40 states.

Personal life

Tom and Judy Love married on December 26, 1961. They have four children and live in Oklahoma City, US. Three of their children work for the company. Frank Love and Greg Love are co-CEOs, and Jenny Love Meyer is the vice president of communications.

Judy Love is Secretary of Love's Travel Stops, and President of Love's Family Foundation. She sits on the boards of Oklahoma City University, SSM Health Care, the St. Anthony Foundation, Oklahoma City Museum of Art, Civic Center Music Hall, Allied Arts, Community Foundation and the University of Central Oklahoma Foundation.
