Christopher Robin Sabat (born April 22, 1973) is an American voice actor, ADR director, and line producer at Funimation who provided voices for a number of English versions of Japanese anime series, and video games. He is the founder and director of the OkraTron 5000 audio production company in Richardson, Texas. He is best known for his voice work on a number of characters, including Vegeta and Piccolo, in the Dragon Ball franchise. He has also voiced such characters as Kazuma Kuwabara in YuYu Hakusho, Ayame Sohma in Fruits Basket, and Kikuchiyo in Samurai 7. Another of his major roles was the voice of Roronoa Zoro in Funimation's re-dubbing of One Piece. He is usually cast in roles which involve him playing a very strong man or very gruff, tough characters.
