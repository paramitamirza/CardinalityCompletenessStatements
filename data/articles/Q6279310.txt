José Ramón Soto Rivera  - better known as Chemo Soto -  is the mayor of Canóvanas, Puerto Rico and a member of the New Progressive Party. 

Soto began his tenure as mayor of Canóvanas when he was elected at the 1992 Puerto Rican general election. Soto beat candidates Estéban Meléndez (PPD) and Eduardo Betancourt (PIP) to win the seat. He has been reelected five consecutive times (1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, and 2012) making him one of the longest tenured mayors in the island.

During his time in office, Soto has become known for his fervent belief in the existence of the Chupacabra. Since the 1990s, Soto has claimed that the mythical creature roams the terrains of Canóvanas. Ever since, he has organized various expeditions to search for it, without success.

In 2014, Soto announced his intention to retire from politics.

Other of his children are Cristal and Christian "Chemito" Soto Mujica. Christian recently pled guilty to drug trafficking charges in US Federal Court.
