Anders Holch Povlsen (born 1972) is a Danish businessman who is the CEO and sole owner of the fashion chain Bestseller, a company founded by his parents, Troels Holch Povlsen and Merete Bech Povlsen. He is also the second largest private landowner in Scotland.

Early life

Anders Holch Povlsen was born in 1972. He is the son of Troels Holch Povlsen and Merete Bech Povlsen, who founded Bestseller in Ringk√∏bing, Denmark in 1975.

Career

He inherited his parents's business, Bestseller, when he was twenty-eight years old. He eventually became its only owner. He serves as its Chief Executive Officer.

In 2013, Povlsen bought a 10% stake in the German internet clothes retailer Zalando, becoming the third largest shareholder. Bestseller already has a 27% stake in ASOS.com, the largest UK internet-only fashion retailer.

According to Forbes, Povlsen has a net worth of $5.8 billion, as of June 2015.

Landowner

In 2012, The Daily Telegraph reported that Povlsen owns about 120000 acre in Scotland, having bought two further large estates, the 24,000-acre Ben Loyal, and 18,000-acre Kinloch, both in Sutherland. These are in addition to a 47,000-acre estate he bought in Inverness-shire in 2006 and a 30,000-acre estate near Fort William that he bought in 2008.

In 2013, The Herald reported that Povlsen had bought the 20000 acre Gaick Estate in Inverness-shire earlier that year, bringing his total to 150000 acre, second only to the Buccleuch Estates as Scotland's largest private landowner. In addition, Povlsen had bought land in the Borders specifically to trade it with the Forestry Commission, in return for 1,000 acres of woodland to add to his 43,000-acre Glenfeshie Estate, south of Aviemore. Povlsen bought Glenfeshie in 2006, and expanded it by buying the 4,000-acre neighbouring farm of Killiehuntly.

In Denmark, Holch Povlsen owns and resides at the old Constantinsborg Estate west of Aarhus, along with substantial farmland and forests. He has also bought land in Romania's Carpathian Mountains to create a wilderness reserve for the surviving wolves, bears and lynx.
