Alfred Gomolka (born 21 July 1942 in Breslau) is a German politician and Member of the European Parliament for Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. He was a member of the conservative Christian Democratic Union of Germany, part of the European People's Party from 1994 to 2008. He is now retired and lives in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.

As Minister President of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Dr Gomolka served as President of the Bundesrat from 1 November 1991 to 19 March 1992. Gomolka tried to avoid the takeover of the East-German shipyards by the West-German Bremer Vulkan AG, which was proposed during the post-communistic privatizations. After he was forced to leave office in 1992, the East German shipyards were sold to the Bremen shipbuilder by his predecessor. In the following years the Bremer Vulkan illegally transferred subsidies of 350 Million Euros to keep jobs at the Shipyards in Bremen running.
