Lester Don Holt, Jr. (born March 8, 1959), is an American journalist. He anchors the weekday edition of NBC Nightly News. He is also the anchor for Dateline NBC. On February 9, 2015, he became the interim weeknight NBC Nightly News anchor, filling in for suspended anchor and managing editor Brian Williams. On June 18, 2015, he was made the permanent anchor of NBC Nightly News after NBC decided to keep Brian Williams as MSNBC breaking news anchor and reporter and fill-in NBC News breaking news anchor and reporter.

Early life and education

Holt was born in Marin County, California, the son of June (DeRozario) and Lester Don Holt, Sr. His maternal grandparents were Jamaican. His maternal grandfather was of half English and half Indian descent.

He graduated from Cordova High School in Rancho Cordova, California in 1977 and attended California State University, Sacramento and majored in Government, though he never graduated. In 2012, Holt told American Profile news magazine: "My first on-air job was actually as a disc jockey at a Country and Western station. The only time I could land a full-time gig was if I was willing to report the news." Holt would keep the job with the radio station through his college years.

Career

Holt spent 19 years with CBS beginning in 1981, when he was hired as a reporter for WCBS-TV in New York City. In 1982, he became a reporter and weekend anchor on KNXT in Los Angeles, and the next year he returned to WCBS-TV as a reporter and weekend anchor. In 1986, Holt moved to WBBM-TV in Chicago, where he spent 14 years anchoring the evening news. Holt not only worked at the anchor desk, but also reported extensively from troubled spots around the world including Iraq, Northern Ireland, Somalia, El Salvador and Haiti.

Holt joined MSNBC in 2000. In 2003, he assumed full-time duties at NBC News, where he became a substitute anchor for NBC Nightly News and Today. Holt became a full-time co-anchor of Weekend Today following the untimely death of previous co-anchor David Bloom. Until late 2005, he also anchored a two-hour daily newscast on MSNBC. On May 9, 2007, Holt was named anchor of the weekend edition of NBC Nightly News, succeeding John Seigenthaler. He also is a current host for NBC's Dateline.

In addition to his primary responsibilities at NBC News, he hosted a special for The History Channel about the 9/11 conspiracy theories, served as a sportsdesk reporter for NBC Sports coverage of the 2008 Summer Olympics, and is the host of Dateline on ID, an edition of Dateline NBC shown on the Investigation Discovery network.  In 2008, he narrated a documentary regarding the actual crystal skulls on the Sci-Fi Channel.

From August 6, 2013 to September 2, 2013, Brian Williams was on medical leave in order to undergo knee replacement surgery. Weekend anchor Lester Holt was interim anchor in his absence.

As a result of controversy involving Brian Williams, Williams announced on February 7, 2015 that he would take a temporary leave of absence from anchoring the Nightly News and that Lester Holt would cover in his absence. Three days later, NBC announced that Williams would be suspended without pay for six months, with Lester Holt filling in as weekday anchor during that period. On June 17, 2015, NBC decided to keep Lester Holt as its permanent NBC Nightly News anchor, while reassigning Williams to MSNBC at the end of his suspension.

Other work

Holt has made cameo appearances in the films The Fugitive (1993); and Primal Fear (1996); as well as on television shows like the episode "Red, White, or Blue" of the series Due South, and "Fate" of Early Edition. He also appeared on the episode "Cleveland" of the NBC sitcom 30 Rock. He played himself anchoring an NBC newscast, but when he turns towards another camera, he looks straight towards a paranoid Tracy Jordan, who was watching the newscast, and told him that "The Black Crusaders" - a group of African-American performers - are going to get him (Tracy believes that this "group" exists). He also did a voice-over in the episode "Sandwich Day", announcing that Jack Donaghy would be a new cabinet member in the Bush administration. Tina Fey commented in that episode's commentary that Holt is a great guy and he is very flexible. Holt announced the 2006, 2007 and 2008 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show for the USA Network. He was also featured in Making Music Magazine.
