Harris Pastides (born 1954, Astoria, Queens, New York) is the 28th president of the University of South Carolina. He started his tenure on August 1, 2008. 

Early life and education

Pastides was born in New York City to immigrants from Cyprus. He was the first person in his family to attend college when he enrolled in the University at Albany where he obtained his B.S. in Biology. He received his master's in public health and his Ph.D. in epidemiology from Yale University.

Before joining the USC faculty, Pastides was a professor of epidemiology and chairman of the department of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.

President of the University of South Carolina

His election by the board of trustees marks the first internal candidate for the presidency of the university in more than a half century. Previously, Pastides served as vice president for research and health sciences and dean of the Arnold School of Public Health. He and his wife, Patricia, first came to the university in 1998.

Under his leadership, Carolina's student population has grown to record levels among the system's eight universities on 12 campuses. Knowing that degree attainment significantly affects the quality of life in South Carolina, Pastides has spearheaded nontraditional programs such as Palmetto College, Back to Carolina, Gamecock Gateway and Gamecock Guarantee to increase university access and affordability. In addition, he leads an unprecedented capital campaign to fund essential needs for knowledge, research, discovery and development.
