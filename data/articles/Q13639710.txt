John Michie (born 25 October 1956) is a Burmese-born Scottish television and film actor, known for his roles as DI Robbie Ross in the STV detective drama series Taggart, and as Karl Munro in Coronation Street from 2011 to 2013 as well as his role as CEO Guy Self in Holby City.

Early life

Born in Burma, Michie was brought up in Kenya until he was 12, when his family settled in Edinburgh, Scotland, later sending him to study at Glenalmond College. At the age of 19 he worked his passage to Australia on a cargo ship, where he spent a year as a jackaroo herding cattle before returning to Scotland. He took a job as a stage hand at the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh, where his interest in acting started. He returned to Kenya when he was 22, beginning his acting career in A Private Matter at the Donovan Maule Theatre, Nairobi in 1980.

Career

Television

Michie appeared in Moon and Son in 1992. In 1998, he was given a regular part in Taggart, playing DI Robbie Ross, a dedicated detective not afraid to go about things his own way and fly in the face of authority when he needs to. In 2002 Michie starred in Wire in the Blood, playing child killer Jack Vance in two episodes Shadows Rising parts 1 and 2. Michie also continued his role on Taggart until 2010. From 2011 to 2013, Michie played Karl Munro in Coronation Street. His character was the partner of Stella Price (Michelle Collins). Since quitting Coronation Street, Michie has played a regular role in hospital drama Holby City, playing Guy Self and while continuing the role in 2014, he has also appeared in its sister show Casualty

Presenting

In recent years, Michie has become increasingly involved in the factual production sector. His first presenting role was for the one hour documentary Murder Capital, which was produced by STV for The Crime & Investigation Network. It was during filming of Murder Capital that Michie met STV producer Mick McAvoy and together they developed the idea for Michie’s next series Highlands. This six part historical documentary series focused on the Highland Clearances of the late 18th and 19th centuries. John’s most recent presenting work was for STV’s Made in Scotland for which he is also executive producer. This documentary series examines the symbols of Scotland. The final episode saw John unveil a newly designed Michie Tartan. In 2008 Michie publicly back the Scottish Labour Party in the run up to the Glasgow East by-election. However it later emerged Michie, in a report for the BBC's This Week programme the previous year, appeared to back Scottish independence, which the Labour Party opposes. Michie said, "An independent Scotland would find a new confidence. It would slow down the brain-drain that causes this country to lose so many of its most brightest and most skilled." The Labour Party subsequently issued a statement on behalf of Michie claiming he did not support independence. 

Voice over

Michie is the voice behind Windfall Films’ Big, Bigger, Biggest and Monster Moves series for Five (TV channel). Big, Bigger, Biggest explores the engineering marvel of large buildings and sky scrapers, while Monster Moves documents the most daring and dangerous relocation projects ever attempted. Other voice over work has included Channel 4’s The Gunpowder Plot, and six titles in the series Football Stories.

Films

Michie’s first film role was in the 1989 film Conquest of the South Pole but his first leading role came in the film adaptation, Monk Dawson in 1998. Based on the Piers Paul Read novel, it gained a good reception from the critics despite only a short run at the UK box office. Michie played the character David Baird in John Madden’s 1996 film Truth or Dare starring Helen Baxendale and John Hannah. In 1999 John starred alongside Richard Harris in To Walk with Lions, a film based on the life of George Adamson. This sees Michie back in his childhood home of Kenya playing the wildlife conservationist Tony Fitzjohn.

Stage

Michie began his acting career on the stage and has appeared in several West End productions. Most recently he played Danny in Breed, a new play from emerging playwright Lou Ramsden, staged at Theatre503 in 2010. Past roles include playing Arthur in Jean Anouilh’s comedy, Number One, at the Queen’s Theatre in 1984. He also played John in Noël Coward’s play, Easy Virtue, at the Garrick Theatre in 1988-89, before going on to play Walker in Andrew Davies’ Prin at the Lyric Theatre, 1989-90, directed by One Foot in the Grave star Richard Wilson. Michie was directed by Wilson twice more in Women Laughing at the Royal Court Theatre and in Simply Disconnected at the Chichester Festival Theatre in 1996.

Personal life

Michie has three children with his partner Carol, a former Hot Gossip dancer. He is a keen swimmer and player of squash, as well as being a big fan of 'the great outdoors.' His nephew is actor Jamie Michie, who has appeared in The IT Crowd, Game of Thrones and alongside John in one episode of Taggart in 2010. In August 2014, Michie was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September's referendum on that issue.
