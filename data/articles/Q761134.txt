George Gordon, 9th Marquess of Huntly KT (28 June 1761 - 17 June 1853), styled Lord Strathavon until 1795 and known as The Earl of Aboyne from 1795 to 1836, was a Scottish peer.

Huntly was the son of Charles Gordon, 4th Earl of Aboyne, and Margaret, daughter of Alexander Stewart, 6th Earl of Galloway. After succeeding to the title of Earl of Aboyne in 1794 after the death of his father, he also succeeded to the title of Marquess of Huntly after his distant cousin, the 5th Duke of Gordon, died in 1836.

Orton Hall, Peterborough, Cambridgeshire (now a hotel) was the seat of the Marquess of Huntly.

Huntly was a keen cricketer who made four known appearances in first-class matches from 1785 to 1792 (he was styled Lord Strathavon on the scorecards). He was a member of the White Conduit Club and an early member of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), but he was mainly associated with Surrey.

On 4 April 1791, he married Catherine Cope, daughter of Sir Charles Cope, 2nd Baronet, and they had nine children:

	 Charles Gordon, 10th Marquess of Huntly (1792-1863)

	 Catherine Susan Gordon, Lady Chesham (1792-1866), married Charles Cavendish, 1st Baron Chesham

	 Reverend Lord George Gordon (1794-1862)

	 Admiral Lord John Frederick Gordon-Hallyburton (1799-1878)

	 Major Lord Henry Gordon (1802-65)

	 Cecil James Gordon (1806-78)
