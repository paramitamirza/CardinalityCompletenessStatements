Early life and education

Trammell was born in Berea, Kentucky, in the infirmary on campus at Berea College where his parents were attending as an undergraduate married couple. He spent time as a child in Kentucky, and then New York City when his father was at Columbia University, and as an adult moved to central Virginia.

His family ancestry dates back to the American colonial period, when Thomas Trammell immigrated to Virginia in 1671, arriving at the port of Alexandria as an indentured servant.

Trammell was a political science undergraduate at Grove City College, where he earned his B.A. He then received advanced degrees or certificates in education, special education, history education, and research methodology, including Master's and PhD degrees from Virginia Commonwealth University, also taking classes through the University of Virginia.

Professional career

Trammell has worked in the procurement area in state government, and as a special education and history teacher in central Virginia's public schools. He currently works at Randolph-Macon College as the Director of Disability Support Services and as an associate professor of Sociology.

Trammell has authored over 20 books, including works of nonfiction, fiction, and children's literature. He writes in many diverse areas ranging from education to history, and has written a number of columns on the American Civil War for The Washington Times. His latest book, The Richmond Slave Trade: The Economic Backbone of The Old Dominion, was published in 2012. He is currently the president of the Blue Ridge chapter of the Virginia Writers Club.

Tramell has focused his professional career on helping people cope with disabilities.

Politics

1980s and 1990s

Trammell's involvement with the Democratic Party began at Grove City College. He worked for the Michael Dukakis presidential campaign in 1988 and on Bill Clinton's 1992 and 1996 presidential campaigns in Kentucky, where he also wrote local position papers and statewide editorials.

2014 midterms elections

Trammell ran for Congress in 2014, to represent the Virginia 7th Congressional district, which is in the Richmond, Virginia, area of the state, facing Dave Brat. He was selected during the weekend of June 7-8, several days before the Republican primary, during a conference call among Democrats of the district. According to Trammell's website, his platform focuses on the need for educational reform, including special education and greater access to college, student loan relief, job creation, accountability in massive public private projects like the expansion of U.S. Route 460, and basic healthcare for every American.

Trammell was defeated by Brat, with James Carr finishing third.

Trammell and his wife Audrie reside on a farm in Louisa County near Mineral, Virginia, with several horses, sheep, and other animals. Jack has three grown children, while Audrie has four.
