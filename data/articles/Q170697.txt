#Type: regular article

Laura Pausini,  (; born 16 May 1974) is an Italian pop singer-songwriter and record producer. As a child, she was encouraged by her father to join him during his performances in local piano bars. After competing in local singing contests, Pausini signed her first recording contract. She rose to fame in 1993, winning the newcomer artists' section of the 43rd Sanremo Music Festival with her debut single "La solitudine", which became an Italian standard and an international hit, topping the charts in Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium. Her eponymous debut album was released in Italy on 23 April 1993 and later became an international success, selling two million copies worldwide.

Its follow-up, Laura, was released in 1994 and confirmed her international success, selling three million copies worldwide. During the same year, she released her first Spanish-language album, Laura Pausini, composed of ten adapted songs originally included in her previous works. The album was certified diamond by the Association of Phonographic and Videographic of Spain, making her the first non-Spanish artist to sell more than one million copies in Spain.

As of 2014, she has released ten studio albums, two international greatest hits albums and two compilation albums for the Hispanic and Anglophone market only, respectively. She mostly performs in Italian and Spanish, but she has also recorded songs in English, French, Portuguese and more recent, Catalan. Her only English-language album, From the Inside, was released in 2002, but failed to satisfy commercial expectations both in North America and in the rest of the world. In 2006, her record Io canto was the best-selling album of the year in Italy.

In 2004, Allmusic's Jason Birchmeier considered Pausini's sales "an impressive feat for someone who'd never really broken into the lucrative English-language market". Fimi certified Pausini's sales of more than 70 million records with a Fimi Icon Award.

During her career, she has won numerous music awards in Italy and internationally.She has earned the first and third place at the Sanremo Music Festival, two "Lunezia Awards", ten Wind Music Awards, four awards at the Festivalbar, seven Telegatti and an MTV Italian Music Award. Internationally, she has won four awards at the Viña del Mar International Song Festival, three Lo Nuestro Awards, three Latin Grammy Awards, a Billboard Latin Music Award and six World Music Awards. In 2006 she also became the first Italian female artist to win a Grammy Award, receiving the accolade for Best Latin Pop Album for the record Escucha. She has been honoured as a Commander Order of Merit of the Italian Republic by President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, and as a World Ambassador of Emilia Romagna.

Childhood and early beginnings

The elder of two daughters, Laura Pausini was born in Faenza, in the Province of Ravenna, Italy, to Fabrizio Pausini and Gianna Ballardini. She grew up in Solarolo, a small comune in the same region.AHer father is a former pianist who also played as a sessionman for ABBA's Frida Lyngstad and entered a band whose members later founded the Italian pop group Pooh. After becoming a piano bar artist, he encouraged Pausini to start performing as a singer.Her first live performance was on 16 May 1985, when she sang together with her father in a restaurant in Bologna.Since then, her father started giving her singing lessons and she continued to perform alongside him in local piano bars. In the meanwhile, she also started singing in a church choir.

In 1987 she recorded her first demo album, produced by her father and released to promote her live shows. Titled I sogni di Laura, it consisted of eight covers and five new songs. In 1991 she participated in the Castrocaro Music Festival singing Liza Minnelli's "New York, New York", but she failed to reach the final stage of the competition. During the same year, she took part in another singing competition, Sanremo Famosi, which should have served as a selection for the newcomers' of the following Sanremo Music Festival. Despite being declared joint winner with another contestant, Pausini was not allowed to compete in the Sanremo Music Festival 1992.

1993: Career breakthrough

Thanks to her performances in local singing competitions, Pausini was noted by Italian producer and songwriter Angelo Valsiglio, who introduced her the manager Marco Marati. Valsiglio proposed her "La solitudine", a song he wrote with Pietro Cremonesi and Federico Cavalli. Pausini's rendition convinced Valsiglio and Marati, who wanted Pausini to audition for some major labels. During one of the auditions, she met Fabrizio Giannini of Warner Music Italy's Compagnia Generale del Disco. After impressing him with a performance of an unreleased Mia Martini song, Pausini obtained her first recording contract, becoming one of the first artists being discovered by Giannini, who later launched the careers of several Italian acts, including Luciano Ligabue and Irene Grandi.

"La solitudine" was selected as one of the entries of the newcomer artists' section of the 43rd Sanremo Music Festival. Pausini performed it for the first time on 23 February 1993, during the first semifinal of the contest. After being admitted to the final, held on 27 February 1993, she won the competition, receiving 7,464 votes by the juries and beating Gerardina Trovato with "Ma non ho più la mia città", who took second place with 7,209 votes.The song also became a commercial success in Italy, peaking at number one on the Italian Musica e dischi singles chart in March 1993 and maintaining the top spot for three consecutive weeks, and it is still one of Pausini's best-known hits.

Following the success obtained with her debut single, Pausini started working on her first professional album, Laura Pausini.The album was recorded while Pausini was still a high school student at the "Gaetano Ballardini" Institute of Ceramics in Faenza, Italy, where she got her diploma a few months after the release of her debut studio set.Released by CGD Records in May 1993, it reached the sixth position on the Italian Musica e dischi albums chart, selling 400,000 copies in Italy.The album was also promoted through an Italian outdoor tour during the summer of 1993. In September 1993, Pausini received a Telegatto for Revelation of the Year.

In late 1993, the album was released in the rest of Europe, peaking at number three on the Dutch Albums Chart and reaching the top spot in Belgium.

Artistry

Laura Pausini is described as a mezzo-soprano with a classic and powerful voice. Due to her voice, Pausini has been compared by music critics to various female artists, including Milva, Celine Dion, Mariah Carey and Barbra Streisand.

At the beginning of her career, she was considered by music critics as a teen idol mainly singing about adolescent love affairs and problems. She was also strongly criticized for her songs, described as too melancholic and trivial.Starting from her 1998s La mia risposta / Mi respuesta, Italian music critics considered her as a more mature singer and later praised her simplicity and her voice, describing Pausini as an interpreter of her years.

Although Pausini is mainly a melodic pop singer, her musical style evolved during her career, with influences from various genres, including Latin music, soul music and rock music. In 2001, David Cazares of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel described Pausinis music as "an assortment of glossy and sentimental pop ballads backed by light rock instrumentation and synthesized strings". In 2006, The Washington Posts Achy Obejas wrote that Pausini is distinguished from other Latin pop singer by her sophistication and her European sensibilities. According to Musica e dischis Antonio Orlando, the key elements in Pausinis style are romanticism, optimism, melancholy and surrounding melodies.

Starting from her 1996s album Le cose che vivi / Las cosas que vives, Pausini has also co-written most of her songs and starting from her 1998s La mia risposta / Mi respuesta she has been involved in the production of her albums.

Personal life

Pausini left her hometown in 1995, when she moved to Milan with her partner, manager and producer Alfredo Cerruti Jr. Their relationship ended in 2002. Between 2002 and 2005 Pausini was romantically involved with her new manager, Gabriele Parisi.She is currently engaged with the Italian guitarist, composer, music producer and former singer Paolo Carta. On 15 September 2012, Pausini confirmed through her official Facebook page that she was expecting her first daughter with her partner Paolo Carta. Their daughter, Paola, was born on 8 February 2013.

Pausini describes herself as a Roman Catholic woman, but expressed doubts about Roman Church's position on various themes, including contraception, abortion and premarital sex. In September 2000 she explained her position during an interview to the Italian newspaper la Repubblica:

 I really believe in God, and the Pope is the man that I most want to meet again in the world. I already met him in 1996. I just have a few doubts about the Catholic Church, such as the discrimination against homosexuals. I don't understand how they condemn racism, but at the same time take issue with gay people.
