John Robert Porter (born 5 January 1953) is an English billionaire businessman and philanthropist best known as the grandson of Sir Jack Cohen founder of Tesco and son of Dame Shirley Porter.

Early life

When John Porter was young, he was given £4 million by his grandfather, Sir Jack Cohen, the founder of Tesco. The gift seems to have made Porter determined to better his grandfather’s achievements through his own business skills. Shrewd investment advice from Green about what to do with the £4 million helped him along the way.

Education

Porter obtained degrees from Oxford, the Institute d’Etudes Politiques in Paris, and Stanford University’s business, where he also is on the advisory council.

Business career

During the early 1990s he became involved with a property development company called Chelverton Investments, owning a 45 percent stake as of 1993. The company made a fortune building shopping centres across the country. His mother’s knowledge of the workings of local council planning committees proved to be of immense value.

But a key plank in John Porter’s empire is the fortune he has made out of a mysterious US computer company called Telos, based in Virginia, which has close ties to the Pentagon. Telos was originally called C3, and specialised in the communication systems that formed the backbone of the US army.
