Biography

Karno was born on 8 October 1960 in Jakarta, the son of actor Soekarno M. Noer and Istriati Rawumali, and grew up in Kemayoran, Central Jakarta. Due to his father's low earnings, he was raised in poverty; he later quipped that his family had had one plate to feed five people, like a popular dangdut song. Although the family's finances would not have been enough to see him through his schooling, he was able to finish his schooling after the fees were reduced by half. As an escape from his family's poverty, Karno would go to a Balai Pustaka-run library and read classic works of Indonesian literature, including novels such as Abdul Muis' Salah Asuhan and the traditional folktale Malin Kundang.

His habit of reading later helped him to land his first acting job. At the age of ten, he attended an audition for a film production of Malin Kundang and, displeased with the changes to the story, blurted out "That's not how the story goes." The director, impressed with Karno's knowledge of the story, cast him. At first, his father did not support his choice as the elder Noer was worried that Karno would continue to be poor.

After Malin Kundang, in 1972 Karno starred in the film adaptation of Si Doel Anak Betawi (Doel, the Betawi Child). After the film's success, Karno starred in several other films, including Rio Anakku (Rio, My Child; 1974) and Di Mana Kau Ibu? (Where Are You Mother?; 1974). In 1979, he starred as Galih in Arizal's film Gita Cinta dari SMA (Love Song from High School); for a period after the film, he was rumoured to be dating his costar, Yessi Gusman.

In 1990, Karno switched to directing; his serial adaptation of Si Doel Anak Betawi, although initially refused by studios for being too "provincial", was highly successful and ran for six seasons. From 1997 to 2002, he served as a member of the People's Consultative Assembly, and from 2002 to 2007, Karno served as UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, promoting literacy.

His first book, The Last Barongsai, was published in 2010; that same year, he released another film, Satu Jam Saja (Just One Hour).

, Karno was planning to make a film adaptation of The Last Barongsai.

Political career

In 2008, Karno ran for deputy regent (wakil bupati) of Tangerang as the partner of incumbent regent (bupati) Ismet Iskandar. The pair won the election and were expected to serve until 2013. While serving as deputy regent Karno continued to be active in the world of entertainment.

In early 2011, Karno began campaigning for governor of Jakarta against incumbent Fauzi Bowo on the Indonesian Democratic Party - Struggle ticket. Despite showing an early lead, in early July Karno cancelled his candidacy for governor of Jakarta to run as Deputy Governor of Banten as the running mate of incumbent Bantan governor Ratu Atut Chosiyah. On 30 October the Banten General Elections Commission announced that Chosiyah-Karno had won the election, with 50% percent of the votes; in mid-December 2011 he resigned as Deputy Regent of Tangerang. He was to be sworn in on 11 January 2012 and is expected to serve until 2017.
