Honeysuckle Hero Susan Weeks (born 1 August 1979) is a British actress known for her starring role as Samantha Stewart in the ITV wartime drama series Foyle's War beginning in 2002.

Early life

Weeks was born in Cardiff, Wales, to Robin and Susan (n√©e Wade) Weeks (who have since divorced), and grew up in Chichester and Petworth. Her parents named her after honeysuckle flowers because they were in bloom when she was born. She has a younger sister Perdita and brother Rollo, both of whom have also pursued careers in acting.

Weeks was educated at Great Ballard School, Sussex, Roedean School and Pembroke College, Oxford, where she read English (graduating with upper-second class honours). She also spent time studying art in Italy. As a child she was a member of the Chichester Festival Theatre. From the age of nine, Weeks studied at the Sylvia Young Theatre School at the weekends. 

Aged 11, Weeks was flown to the United States and cast in the DreamWorks feature A Far Off Place being directed by Steven Spielberg. However, when Spielberg dropped out of the project, Weeks' role was re-cast with Reese Witherspoon.
