Duncan Garner (8 March 1974) is a New Zealand radio and television host and journalist. He took over the Radio Live drive slot in December 2012 and was previously the 3 News political editor in Wellington.

Early life

Garner attended Westlake Boys High School, and the Auckland University of Technology.

Journalism career

He started his career as a reporter for Television New Zealand in 1995, working on the current affairs show Holmes from 2000 to 2002.

Garner then moved to rival TV3 in 2003. He broke the story of the NZ$195,000 golden handshake Labour MP John Tamihere received leaving the Waipareira Trust in October 2004. The story prompted an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office, which caused Tamihere to resign from the Cabinet. Tamihere was later cleared of financial impropriety, and the story won Garner the 2004 Qantas Media Award for Television News Reporter - Politics.

In August 2008, three months before the New Zealand general election, Garner broadcast audio tapes secretly recorded at a National Party cocktail party by Kees Keizer. The tapes caught deputy leader Bill English saying he would sell Kiwibank, and future Speaker of the House of Representatives Lockwood Smith saying National had to adopt policies the party did not like in order not to scare voters. The broadcast earned Garner a nomination for Best News Reporting in the 2009 Qantas Film and Television Awards.

In March 2010, TV3 launched the weekend current affairs program The Nation, with Garner as co-host.

In the wake of the 2010 MPs expenses scandal, Labour politician Chris Carter alleged Garner said "I am going to fucking well get you" to him at an Air New Zealand Koru Club lounge in 2009. The head of TV3 news and current affairs Mark Jennings replied saying Garner did not have a grudge, and "Carter is a serial offender on expenses ... it's Duncan's job to shine the light on that."

In 2013, Garner hosted two new current affairs shows on TV3 - 3rd Degree and The Vote.
