James Albertus Tawney (January 3, 1855 - June 12, 1919) was a blacksmith, machinist and U.S. politician and a member of the United States House of Representatives from Minnesota. He was the first House Majority Whip, holding that position from 1899 to 1905.

Tawney was born in Mount Pleasant Township, near Gettysburg, Adams County, Pennsylvania. He apprenticed with his father as a blacksmith, and subsequently learned the trade of machinist. In 1877, moved to Winona, Minnesota, where he was employed as a blacksmith and machinist until 1881. He attended the law department of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and was admitted to the bar in 1882 and commenced practice in Winona. Tawney was elected to the Minnesota Senate in 1890. In 1892, he was elected to Congress as a Republican, and served in the 53rd, 54th, 55th, 56th, 57th, 58th, 59th, 60th, and 61st congresses. During his time in Congress, Tawney served as Majority Whip and as chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations.

In 1910 he was defeated incumbent in the Republican primary election by 30-year-old Sydney Anderson, who had the support of Theodore Roosevelt, Gifford Pinchot and other Progressive Republican. Anderson ran on a platform of drastically reduced tariffs and opposition to Cannonism (with which Tawney was identified).
