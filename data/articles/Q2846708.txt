Andrew Rainsford Wetmore (August 16, 1820  -  March 7, 1892) was a New Brunswick politician, jurist, and a member of a prominent United Empire Loyalist family. 

Wetmore entered politics in 1865 with his election to the colonial legislature as an Anti-Confederate. His opposition to Canadian confederation dissolved when he didn't get the appointment he expected as Attorney-General in the Anti-Confederate Party's government. Wetmore crossed the floor and joined the Confederation Party which formed the government in 1866. When New Brunswick joined Canada in 1867 many prominent pro-Confederation politicians assumed positions in the Canadian House of Commons, the courts or other offices. Wetmore was able to assume the leadership of the remaining Confederation Party forces in the legislature becoming Premier in 1867. 

Wetmore's government helped finance extensions to rail lines in the province. His government also incorporated the College of Saint Joseph and granted full property rights to all married women living apart from, or deserted by, their husbands.

On May 25, 1870 he retired from politics to accept a position on the New Brunswick Supreme Court.
