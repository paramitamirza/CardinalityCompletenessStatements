Life and works

Levine attended the University of Manitoba and the University of Toronto; he got a PhD in Canadian history from Toronto in 1985. His graduate thesis on the grain business in Winnipeg was turned into his first book in 1987, at which point he was already teaching and freelancing as a journalist.
