Maria Antoinette "Mies" Bouwman (born 31 December 1929) is a retired Dutch television presenter.

Born in Amsterdam, she started her career on the very first broadcasting evening of the Dutch broadcasting association KRO (Catholic Radio Broadcaster) on 16 October 1951.

Bouwman made her name as the host of the first large fund-raising programm on Dutch TV, Open Het Dorp. In this show viewers were asked to donate money for charity, in order to open a special village for people with a handicap. This show was broadcast live on 26 and 27 November 1962 and lasted 23 hours. Bouwman presented the entire show.

Bouwman developed and hosted EÃ©n van de acht, known in the UK as The Generation Game. She hosted numerous talk shows, as well as the Dutch version of This is your life. She stopped her regular work after falling sick but has occasionally returned for special programs.

Bouwman definitively ended her career in 1993 due to health restrictions, and was appointed Knight in the Order of Orange-Nassau. Since then she has appeared on TV for interviews, but never as host, only as a guest.
