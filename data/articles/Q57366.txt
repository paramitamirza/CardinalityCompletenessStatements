Emomalii Rahmon (امام‌علی رحمان), (Эмомалӣ Раҳмон; born 5 October 1952) is a Tajik politician who has served as Tajikistan's head of state since 1992, and as President since 1994.

During the early years of his presidency, Rahmon faced a civil war in which up to 100,000 people died. In 2013, he was elected to a fourth term in office.

Early life

Rahmon was born as Imomali Sharipovich Rakhmonov (Имомали́ Шари́пович Рахмо́нов) to a peasant family in Danghara, Kulob Oblast (present-day Khatlon province). The Russian ending "-ov" was added to the first name of the father of Central Asian men in the 19th century to create surnames reflecting the influence of the Russian Empire. From 1971 to 1974 he served in the Soviet Armed Forces.

As an apparatchik rising through the nomenklatura, his original power base was as chairman of the collective state farm of his native Danghara. In 1982, he graduated from the Tajik State National University with a bachelor's degree in Economics. From 1976 to 1988, he served as Chairman of the Union Committee of the collective farm in Danghara.

Politics

In 1990, Rahmon was elected a people's deputy to the Supreme Council of the Tajik SSR. President Rahmon Nabiyev resigned in the first months of the Civil War in Tajikistan in August 1992. Akbarsho Iskandarov, Speaker of the Supreme Soviet, became acting president. Iskandarov resigned in November in an attempt to end the civil unrest. The Supreme Soviet met in Khujand and abolished the position of president that same month. Rahmon, who was Speaker of Parliament, became the head of government.

During the civil war that lasted from 1992-97, Rahmon's rule was opposed by the United Tajik Opposition. As many as 100,000 people died during the war. He survived an assassination attempt in April 1997 in Khujand, as well as two attempted coups in August 1997 and in November 1998.

On 6 November 1994, he was elected to the newly created post of President of Tajikistan, and he was sworn in ten days later. Following constitutional changes, he was re-elected on 6 November 1999 to a seven-year term, officially taking 97% of the vote. On 22 June 2003, he won a referendum that would allow him to run for two more consecutive seven-year terms after his term expired in 2006. The opposition alleges that this amendment was hidden in a way that verged upon electoral fraud. Rahmon was re-elected in a controversial election on 6 November 2006, with about 79% of the vote, according to the official results.

Name changes

In March 2007, Rahmonov changed his forename to Emomali and surname to Rahmon after a decree banned Slavic names endings and other Soviet-era practices. He urged other Tajiks to follow his example and return to their cultural and national roots.

Religion and convictions

Rahmon is a Sunni Muslim and performed the hajj in March 1997. He has called for closer ties with other Muslim nations in the region, notably the Persian-speaking nations of Iran and Afghanistan. 

His reply to critics of the election standards of the 2006 Tajikistani presidential elections was:During a 2010 Organisation of the Islamic Conference session hosted in Dushanbe, Rahmon spoke against what he deemed was the misuse of Islam toward political ends, claiming that "Terrorism, terrorists, have no nation, no country, no religion ... Using the name 'Islamic terrorism' only discredits Islam and dishonors the pure and harmless religion of Islam."

Family

He is married to Azizmo Asadullayeva and has nine children: seven daughters and two sons.
