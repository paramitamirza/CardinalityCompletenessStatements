Academic career

Clark matriculated at Harvard University in 1967 as a pre-med major and left after his freshman year to serve as a missionary for the LDS Church in Germany. Following his mission, Clark enrolled for a time at Brigham Young University. In 1971, he resumed his studies at Harvard, where he received B.A. (1974), MA (1977), and Ph.D. (1978) degrees in economics.

Clark joined the Harvard faculty in 1978 and served as Dean of the HBS from 1995 to 2005.

As a professor at the HBS, Clark's research focused on modularity in design and the integration of technology and competition in industry evolution, particularly within the computer industry. He has published several articles in the Harvard Business Review and other peer-reviewed academic journals. A few of his papers were co-authored with former HBS associate dean and former BYU-Hawaii president Steven C. Wheelwright.

In 2005, Clark left the HBS when LDS Church president Gordon B. Hinckley appointed him president of BYU-Idaho.

On January 27, 2015, it was announced that effective April 13, 2015, Clark would be succeeded by Clark Gilbert as the president of BYU-Idaho.
