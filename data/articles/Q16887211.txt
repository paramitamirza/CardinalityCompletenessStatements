Billy Zeoli is an American evangelical media executive producer from Grand Rapids, Michigan who once served as a White house chaplain to U.S. President Gerald R. Ford and Betty Ford during the mid-1970s and who offered advice as a spiritual counselor to President Ford on the question of issuing a pardon to former U.S. President Richard Nixon, who had resigned following the Watergate scandal as a result of the June 17, 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C., and the Nixon administration's attempted cover-up of its involvement.

Zeoli received recognition as a minister to several American major league professional sport teams and athletes.

Zeloi was also instrumental in bringing together the American missionary theologian Francis Schaeffer of the L'Abri in Hu√©moz-sur-Ollon, Switzerland and his son, Frank Schaeffer with wealthy American evangelicals (such as Amway co-founder and multi-billionaire Richard DeVos) for the financial backing of the How Should We Then Live: The Rise and Decline of Western Thought and Culture 1997 film and 2005 television series.

The American distribution of the How Should We Then Live: The Rise and Decline of Western Thought and Culture book, the U.S. distribution of the film of the same title by Zeoli's Gospel Films, Inc., and subsequent film tour in the United States by the Schaeffers was responsible for bringing many evangelical Protestants into the then largely Roman Catholic public protest movement against the United States Supreme Court Roe v. Wade decision,  supporting legal abortion in the United States.

Zeoli is also Co-Chair of Gospel Communications International (along with Doug DeVos), which developed (and later sold during 2008) the Bible Gateway web site and also trained and hosted hundreds of evangelical ministries on the World Wide Web beginning in 1995.
