Madhav S Shinde (माधव एस शिंदे) ( 1929  -  28 September 2012), credited as M. S. Shinde, was a Bollywood film editor who edited over 100 films, notably the cult hit Sholay (1975). Other notables films he worked on include Seeta Aur Geeta, Brahmachari, Shaan and Chamatkar. He received the Filmfare Best Editor award for Sholay in 1975.

Career

Shinde started his career as an editor for Bollywood films in 1960s. Even before editing the classic 1975 release film Sholay, Shinde had worked with director Ramesh Sippy and producer G. P. Sippy on the 1972 film Seeta Aur Geeta starring Hema Malini. Shinde worked for a monthly salary of 2,000 for the Sippys' production house. His work on Sholay of editing 300,000 feet of reel into 18,000 feet is considered remarkable. The earlier submitted version of 21,000 feet long film was further edited after the censors mandated cuts. The film had been reduced to a running time of 3 hours and 20 minutes, and was now without many of its gory scenes, though violence remained both on- and off-screen. Sholay was nominated in nine categories at the 23rd Filmfare Awards but won only the Best Editing Award.

Shinde worked on over 100 Bollywood films. The list of his works includes some successful films like Raaz (1967), Brahmachari (1968), Shaan (1980), Shakti (1982), Razia Sultan (1983), Sohni Mahiwal (1984), Saagar (1985) and Chamatkar (1992). His last film was Zamaana Deewana (1995), starring Shahrukh Khan. Along with films, Shinde was also the editor of the Hindi television classic Buniyaad that aired on DD National in 1986.
