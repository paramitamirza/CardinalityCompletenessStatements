Mirosława Danuta Wałęsa, maiden surname Gołoś (born 25 February 1949 near Węgrów), is the wife of the former President of Poland  Lech Wałęsa. In 1983 she accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, Norway on behalf of her husband, who feared, at a time of great political upheaval in the country, that the Polish government might not allow him to return if he travelled to Oslo himself. Lech and Danuta have been married since November 8, 1969 and have eight children:

	Bogdan - b. 1970

	Sławomir - b. 1972

	Przemysław - b. 1974

	Jarosław - b. 1976

	Magdalena - b. 1979

	Anna - b. 1980

	Maria Wiktoria - b. 1982

	Brygida - b. 1985.

Danuta grew up in Krypy village near Węgrów (Krypy, Gmina Wierzbno or Krypy, Gmina Liw). She was working in a flower shop near the Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk when she met Lech Wałęsa, then an electrician. After they married, she began using her middle name more than her first name, per Lech's request. She was even more resolutely anti-Communist than her husband. During her husband's frequent interrogations by the SB in the 1980s, she was known to openly taunt officers who came to pick him up.
