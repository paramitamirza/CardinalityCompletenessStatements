Martynas Goštautas (Marcin Janowicz Gas(z)tołd or Marcin Gasztołdowicz; Га́штовт Марти́н Іва́нович; 1428, Vilnius - c. 1483, Vilnius) was a nobleman from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania of the Goštautai family. He was the Grand Marshal of Lithuania, Voivode of Navahrudak (1464-1471), first Voivode of Kiev (1471-1475) and Voivode of Trakai (1480-1483). He was a servant to King Casimir Jagiellon, and was a founder of Tykocin monastery and the Dominican monastery and church in Trakai.

Residents of Kiev resented the appointment of a Roman Catholic as voivode and refused to let him in. In exchange, Kiev acquired the status of a voivodeship, equal to that of Trakai and  Vilnius and the subsequent voivodes were Orthodox nobles.

Martynas was a son of Jonas Goštautas, carrying his first name as a patronymic, and father of Albertas Goštautas.
