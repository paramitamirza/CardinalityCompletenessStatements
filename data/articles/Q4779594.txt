Ada Colau Ballano (; ; Barcelona, 3 March 1974), is a Spanish political and social activist, and the current Mayor of Barcelona since 13 June 2015, the first woman to hold the office. Colau was one of the founding members and spokespeople of the Plataforma de Afectados por la Hipoteca (PAH) (Platform for People Affected by Mortgages), which was set up in Barcelona in 2009 in response to the rise in evictions caused by abusive mortgage clauses and the collapse of the Spanish property market in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.

Early life

Ada Colau was born in Barcelona and grew up in the Guinardó neighbourhood. She went to school at the Santa Anna and Febrer Academies, and went on to study philosophy at the University of Barcelona.

Platform for People Affected by Mortgages

Ada Colau was one of the founding members of the Platform for People Affected by Mortgages (PAH) in 2009, and acted as the organization's spokeswoman until 2014. Colau rose to national prominence after calling a representative of the Spanish Banking Association “a criminal” while representing the PAH at a parliamentary hearing on the housing crisis in February 2013. Colau supports the use of 'escraches', public protests outside the homes of government officials. That same month, a Popular Legislative Initiative proposed by the PAH and supported by over 1,400,000 signatories was debated on the floor of the Spanish Congress. This was followed by a speech to the European Parliament Committee on Petitions in Brussels. In March, Madrid Government delegate Cristina Cifuentes of the People's Party accused Colau of being linked to terrorist group ETA. Colau is coauthor of the book Mortgaged Lives, based on her experiences of grassroots campaigning and direct action with the PAH.

Barcelona en Comú

On May 7, 2014 Ada Colau announced her resignation as spokesperson of the PAH. Since June 2014  she has been the main spokesperson for Barcelona en Comú (formerly known as Guanyem Barcelona), a citizen platform standing in the May 2015 Barcelona municipal elections. She won a simple majority in the elections and on 13 June 2015 she became mayor with the favourable vote of an absolute majority of councillors.
