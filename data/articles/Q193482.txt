Neve Adrianne Campbell (; born October 3, 1973) is a Canadian actress. She appeared in the Canadian television series Catwalk, before she played Julia Salinger in the drama series Party of Five. She has also appeared in films, such as The Craft (1996). She is well known for her role as Sidney Prescott in the horror film series Scream. She also starred in the thriller Wild Things (1998) and later several films that were critically acclaimed but had a limited theatrical release, such as Panic (2000) and The Company (2003). She made guest appearances on several television shows, such as Medium, Grey's Anatomy and Mad Men.

Early life

Campbell was born in Guelph, Ontario. Her mother, Marnie (n√©e Neve), is a yoga instructor and psychologist from Amsterdam. Her father, Gerry Campbell, immigrated to Canada from Glasgow, Scotland, and taught high school drama classes in Mississauga, Ontario (first at Westwood Secondary School, later at Lorne Park Secondary School, and now at Erindale Secondary School). Campbell's maternal grandparents ran a theater company in the Netherlands, and her paternal grandparents were also performers. On her mother's side, Campbell descends from Sephardi Jews who immigrated to the Netherlands and converted to Catholicism. She has stated: "I am a practising Catholic, but my lineage is Jewish, so if someone asks me if I'm Jewish, I say yes".

Campbell has three brothers: Christian, Alex, and Damian (known as Damian McDonald). Her parents divorced when she was two years old. At age six, Neve saw a performance of The Nutcracker and decided she wanted to take ballet, enrolling at the Erinvale School of Dance. She and her brother Christian lived mostly with their father (who received custody of the two), with regular periods at their mother's home until Neve was nine years old. At that time, she moved into residence at the National Ballet School of Canada, training there and appearing in performances of The Nutcracker and Sleeping Beauty. After accumulating numerous dance-related injuries and a stress-induced nervous breakdown, she moved into acting at the age of 15, performing in The Phantom of the Opera at the Canon Theatre in Toronto while attending Guelph Collegiate Vocational Institute in Guelph.

Career

Campbell appeared in a 1991 Coca-Cola commercial and promotes its sponsorship on Bryan Adams' Waking Up the Nation Tour (1991-1992). Her first starring role was as Daisy in the Canadian youth series Catwalk, (1992-1994). She made several guest appearances on shows such as The Kids In The Hall, Are You Afraid of the Dark? and Kung Fu: The Legend Continues. Described as "television's most believable teenager", Campbell rose to fame outside Canada after playing Julia Salinger in the drama series Party of Five, (1994-2000). The show won the Golden Globe Award for Best Drama in 1996.

Campbell's first widely released film was The Craft (1996). She starred as Sidney Prescott in Scream (1996), which was a huge success, earning over $173 million at the worldwide box office and winning critical acclaim. Her role has received significant critical praise throughout the Scream series, earning her the Saturn Award for Best Actress for her role in Scream. The film was followed by three sequels, all of which were also successful, with Scream 2 earning over $170 million, Scream 3 over $160 million, and Scream 4 over $97 million. Campbell won the MTV Movie Award for Best Female Performance for Scream 2. In his review of Scream 3, Roger Ebert wrote: "The camera loves her. She could become a really big star and then giggle at clips from this film at her AFI tribute." Campbell appeared in Wild Things and 54, both of which were moderately successful. She also voiced Kiara in the Disney animated direct-to-video, The Lion King II: Simba's Pride.

Following the third film in the Scream series, Campbell appeared in several films that received a limited theatrical release but were well reviewed by critics, including the 2000 film Panic, in which she appeared alongside William H.

Campbell co-wrote, produced and starred in the 2003 film The Company, about Chicago's Joffrey Ballet, and the independent film When Will I Be Loved (2004), which was praised by critic Roger Ebert, but received only a brief and limited theatrical release. In Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide (2009 edition), the film critic describes it as an "Unlikable film ... crammed with coldhearted characters who are obsessed with big bucks, sleazy sex, and endless hustling."

In March 2006, Campbell made her West End theatre debut, in a version of Arthur Miller's Resurrection Blues at the Old Vic theatre. Matthew Modine and Maximilian Schell also appeared in the play, which received mixed reviews.
