Political career

D'Arcy first held political office in December 2003, when he was co-opted to Wexford County Council as a councillor for Gorey to replace his father Michael who had been forced to stand down when the Local Government Act 2001 abolished the dual mandate. He was re-elected at the 2004 local elections.

He served as Chairman of County Wexford Vocational Education Committee from 2004 to 2007. There was controversy in 2006 when the Committee's decision to provide premises for the Institute of Technology, Carlow in Wexford town undermined the position of Gorey School of Art.

He served as the party Deputy spokesperson on Justice, with special responsibility for Equality from 2007 to 2010, and was the party Deputy spokesperson on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, with special responsibility for Telecommunications from 2010 to 2011. 

He lost his seat at the 2011 general election to party colleague Liam Twomey. He was subsequently elected to Seanad Éireann on the Administrative Panel in April 2011. He is the Fine Gael Seanad spokesperson on Finance.
