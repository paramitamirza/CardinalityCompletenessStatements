Sir Thomas Frankland, 6th Baronet (September 1750 - January 4, 1831) was a British landowner and Member of Parliament.

He was born in London, the oldest surviving son of Admiral Sir Thomas Frankland, 5th Baronet and his wife Sarah Rhett and was educated at Merton College, Oxford and Lincoln's Inn (1772). He succeeded to the baronetcy and Thirkleby Hall on the death of his father in 1784 and commissioned James Wyatt to rebuild the hall in 1790. The estate was auctioned after the First World War but the hall was not sold; it was dismantled in 1927.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1773. He was elected MP for Thirsk in 1774 (sitting until 1780) and again in 1796 (until 1801). He served as High Sheriff of Yorkshire for 1792-93.

He died at Thirkleby Hall near Thirsk in 1831. He had married Dorothy, daughter of William Smelt and had five children of whom only his heir, Sir Robert Frankland, 7th Baronet, survived. There is a memorial (by sculptor John Flaxman R.A.) to four of their children in All Saints Church, Great Thirkleby.
