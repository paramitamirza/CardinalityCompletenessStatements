General Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl of Harrington, G.C.H., PC, PC (Ire) (17 March 1753  -  5 September 1829), styled Viscount Petersham until 1779, was a British soldier. Stanhope is sometimes confused with an exact contemporary of his, the 3rd Earl Stanhope.

Early life

Stanhope was the son of William Stanhope, 2nd Earl of Harrington and Lady Caroline Fitzroy, daughter of Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton and Lady Henrietta Somerset, daughter of Charles Somerset, Marquess of Worcester and Rebecca Child. He was educated at Eton.

Military career

Stanhope was commissioned into the Coldstream Guards in 1769. He was briefly Member of Parliament for Thetford and then for Westminster. During the Saratoga campaign of the American Revolutionary War as Viscount Petersham, Charles Stanhope commanded the 29th Regiment of Foot's Grenadier company and as an aide-de-camp to General John Burgoyne.

Viscount Petersham can be seen in the famous painting "The Burial of General Fraser at Saratoga" standing above Simon Fraser.
