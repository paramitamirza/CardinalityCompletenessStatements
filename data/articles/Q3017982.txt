David Gourd (10 February 1885  -  29 December 1982) was a Liberal party member of the Canadian House of Commons. He was born in Saint-Victor d'Alfred, Ontario and became a financier and merchant by career.

Early in his career, he moved to Amos, Quebec as one of the new town's first settlers, establishing a general store there. He later became the town's mayor and head of the local chamber of commerce.

He was first elected to Parliament at the Chapleau riding in the 1945 general election, then re-elected in 1949 and 1953. Gourd left federal politics after the end of his third term, the 22nd Canadian Parliament, and did not seek re-election in 1957.
