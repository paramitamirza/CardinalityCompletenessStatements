Ben Byer (January 8, 1971 - July 3, 2008) was an American stage actor and playwright. His experiences after being diagnosed with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are documented in the 2007 film Indestructible.

Biography

Early life and education

Benjamin Saul Byer was born January 8, 1971 to Barbara and Stephen Byer. One of five children, he graduated from Evanston Township High School. He studied journalism at Indiana University and film theory at the University of Paris.

Career

Byer began his career as a translator at the Cannes Film Festival, which led him to theatre and movie industry jobs in Los Angeles. He also worked in theatre in Chicago as a playwright and actor. He directed his first play, Take it Deep, in 2000.

After being diagnosed with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in 2002, he began documenting his life on camera. He spent the next three years keeping a video diary as he sought treatments in six countries, including having fetal cells injected directly into his brain in 2004. Although Byer did show improvements in his speech in the days following the procedure, the improvements did not last. Within the first month following the procedure, his previous ALS symptoms had returned. His footage was incorporated into film shot by Roko Belic to form the 2007 documentary film Indestructible film.

Marriage and children

Byer and his wife, Josephine Christopher, adopted a son, John Anthony Byer, shortly before his diagnosis with ALS.

Death and afterward

Byer died of ALS complications on July 3, 2008 in Cleveland, Ohio. He was interred at Shalom Memorial Park in Arlington Heights, Illinois.
