Alasdair Fraser (born 14 May 1955, Clackmannan, Scotland) is a Scottish fiddler.

Fraser operates Culburnie Records, and is a leading artist on the label. He has founded three summer fiddling programs: the Valley of the Moon fiddle camp in California (begun in 1984), a week-long course on the Isle of Skye (begun in 1987) and the more recent Sierra Fiddle Camp in California (begun in 2006). Adept in various Scottish idioms, in recent years, with cellist Natalie Haas, he has helped reconstruct and revive the Scottish tradition of playing dance music on violin and cello ("wee fiddle" and "big fiddle"). Fraser lives in northern California with his wife and two sons.
