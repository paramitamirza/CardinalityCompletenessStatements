Early life

Manford was born in Salford, Greater Manchester. His mother, Sharon (n√©e Ryan), is of Irish Catholic extraction. She gave birth to him when she was sixteen. His father is Ian Manford, a courtroom stenographer. He grew up in a terraced house in what is known as the "Triangle of Death" area of Manchester notorious for its gang activity and high crime rate. He has three younger brothers: Stephen, Colin and Niall, and a younger sister, Danielle.

When Manford was seventeen, he got a job as a glass collector at a local pub.
