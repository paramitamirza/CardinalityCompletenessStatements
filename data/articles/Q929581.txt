Jeffry Lane "Jeff" Flake (born December 31, 1962) is an American politician and the junior United States Senator from Arizona. He served as a U.S. Representative for Arizona from 2001 to 2013, representing  (initially ). He is a member of the Republican Party.

Flake was the 2012 Republican nominee to represent Arizona in the U.S. Senate. He defeated Democrat Richard Carmona in the general election on November 6, 2012.

In 2013, the National Taxpayers Union gave Flake the Taxpayers’ Friend Award. The Union keeps a scorecard on Members of Congress, rating Members on certain votes. Flake’s score was the highest of anyone in Congress for 2013. Upon receiving the award, Flake referred to himself as “the biggest cheapskate in the Senate.”

Early life, education, and early career

Flake was born in Snowflake, Arizona, the son of Nerita (née Hock) and Dean Maeser Flake. His birth town was named in part for his great-great-grandfather, Mormon pioneer William J. Flake. Flake obtained both an undergraduate and graduate degree from Brigham Young University and was a Mormon missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to South Africa in the early 1980s. He speaks Afrikaans. He worked in the public affairs sector after college and served as Executive Director of the Foundation for Democracy in Namibia and Executive Director of the Goldwater Institute before entering the House of Representatives. He opposed economic sanctions on South Africa in the 1980s.

U.S. House of Representatives

Elections

Flake was first elected to what was then  in 2000, after Republican incumbent Matt Salmon stepped down to honor a self-imposed term limit. The district, which included most of the East Valley, was then renumbered to the 6th district as Arizona gained two Congressional seats due to the results of the 2000 census.

In his campaign in 2000, Flake had pledged to serve no more than three terms in Congress which would see him serve no later than January 2007. Shortly after being elected for a third time, Flake announced in early 2005 that he had changed his mind on pledging term limits and was planning to run for re-election in 2006. "It was a mistake to limit my own terms," Flake said.

Flake easily defeated his primary challenger.  In that same election, three out of five mayors in his home district opposed his re-election because, according to Flake, he did not "bring pork barrel spending" to the mayors' cities.  In 2006, several Democrats had announced their intention to run for the seat; however, only one met the June filing deadline, and that particular filing was rejected due to an insufficient number of nominating signatures. "I did expect to have a primary opponent. I deserve one," Flake said, referring to the term-limit pledge which he had broken. "By all rights, I ought to have an opponent. I just got lucky, I guess."

In the 2006 mid-term elections, Flake had no Democratic Party opponent and easily defeated the Libertarian Party candidate, Jason Blair, with 74% of the vote.

Tenure

	Spending

Flake is a fiscal conservative. He is a critic of government waste and advocates reducing federal spending. He was described by columnist Robert Novak as an "insistent reformer". He is a signer of the Taxpayer Protection Pledge and one of eight House members to receive a 100% approval rating from the American Conservative Union. In 2008, Flake voted against the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).

A "scourge of pork-barrel spending", Flake was ruled the least profligate spender in Congress by Citizens Against Government Waste in July 2007 and designated a "taxpayer superhero."  In September 2010, Flake introduced a series of press releases under the title "So Just How Broke Are We?", in which explains the size of the national debt ($13 trillion) in terms of recent events, followed by a pun. As an example, noting that the cheapest 2010 World Series ticket on StubHub.com at AT&T Park was $425, it would take 30.6 billion tickets sold to pay down the debt, whereupon he remarked, "Looks like the voters are about to bring in some (debt) relievers."

	Earmarks

Flake is "known for his ardent opposition to earmarks." He has been called an "anti-earmark crusader," and frequently challenges earmarks proposed by other members of Congress. Since May 2006, he has become prominent with the "Flake Hour," a tradition at the end of spending bill debates in which he asks earmark sponsors to come to the house floor and justify why taxpayers should pay for their "pet projects." He is credited with prompting House rule changes to require earmark sponsors to identify themselves.

Until September 2010, Flake issued a press release listing an "egregious earmark of the week" every Friday. Usually the earmark will be followed by Flake making a humorous comment; as an example, Rep. Flake once said of Congressman Jose Serrano's $150,000 earmark to fix plumbing in Italian restaurants, "I would argue this is one cannoli the taxpayer doesn’t want to take a bite of." The "earmark of the week" releases were ended and replaced with the "So Just How Broke Are We?" series of releases.

In March, 2010, the House Appropriations Committee implemented rules to ban earmarks to for-profit corporations, a change Flake supported. “This is the best day we’ve had in a while,” he said to the New York Times, which reported that approximately 1,000 such earmarks were authorized in the previous year, worth $1.7 billion.

	Immigration

In 2007, Flake introduced legislation that would have provided a path to legalization for illegal immigrants, granted temporary legal status to illegal immigrants who paid a fine and passed background checks, and created a guest worker program. The Cato Institute credited the immigration bill that Flake sponsored in the House as the source of President George W. Bush's immigration proposal.

In 2007, Flake was removed from the House Judiciary Committee by Speaker of the House John Boehner for "bad behavior", which Boehner said was criticism of party leaders, though Flake himself attributed it to his support of comprehensive immigration reform.

In 2009, Flake introduced the Stopping Trained in America PhDs From Leaving the Economy (STAPLE) Act (H.R. 1791). The bill would have authorized students who earned a Ph.D. in a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics from U.S. universities to be admitted for permanent residence and to be exempted from the numerical limits on H-1B nonimmigrants. The bill was reintroduced in 2011 and was referred to the Subcommittee on Immigration Policy and Enforcement in February of that year.

Some of Flake's work toward immigration reform in the mid-2000s was documented in the series How Democracy Works Now: Twelve Stories.

In 2010, Flake voted against the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, which failed in the Senate. In late October 2012, Flake stated that he may support it in the future.

In January 2013, Flake became a member of a bi-partisan group of eight Senators (The "Gang of Eight"), which drafted an immigration reform (CIR) bill.

	Foreign policy

Flake voted in favor of the authorization of force bill against the country of Iraq (Iraq War) in the House of Representatives in October 2002. In a debate on the House floor on the authorization of force (October 8, 2002), Flake said, "We ought to let history be our guide here. But the most recent history in this case that we ought to look at is the vote that took place in this Chamber 12 years ago. During that time, we faced a very similar decision. Should we thwart Saddam Hussein in his attempt to go beyond his boundaries or should we appease him? Fortunately, the majority of this body and the other body agreed we ought to thwart him; and I think we can all agree that, had we not done so, that the biological and chemical weapons that Saddam Hussein possesses would be added to nuclear weapons which he would certainly possess today had he not been thwarted at that time. We are in this position today, I would submit, because we have no other choice. This is our only reasonable option. War will no doubt come at great cost. When we visit the war memorials, we see that cost, but the cost of appeasement is far greater. I commend the House leadership for bringing this resolution forward and for shepherding it through process. I especially commend our President who so forcefully pushed for this resolution and who has so deliberately pushed for this resolution. I urge support for the resolution." 

After the 2006 election in which Republicans lost control of the House of Representatives largely due to the unpopularity of the war in Iraq, Flake changed his position on the Iraq War to one of cautious opposition, including voting against appropriations. At a 2008 congressional hearing featuring General David Petraeus, Flake said, "I still have a hard time seeing the big picture and what constitutes success Iraq. That's not just one side of the aisle with those kind of concerns. Many on this side of the aisle have that as well."

Flake supports ending the Cuba Trade Embargo and otherwise normalizing relations with Cuba.

	Social issues

In October 2008, Esquire named Congressman Flake one of the Ten Best Members of Congress saying in part, "A true conservative, Flake is as rare as the dodo. Republicans should learn from him, and liberals and libertarians will find in him a strong privacy-rights ally."

Flake is pro-life, as demonstrated by his 100% rating from the National Right to Life Committee.

In 2007, Flake voted in favor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) which would have banned discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. In December 2010, Flake was one of fifteen Republican House members to vote in favor of repealing the United States military's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" ban on openly gay service members. Flake had voted to amend the U.S. Constitution to ban same-sex marriage with a Federal Marriage Amendment in 2004 and 2006. As a senator, Flake was one of 10 Senate Republicans to vote, once more, in favor of ENDA.

	USA Patriot Act

During the 2005 debate on renewal of the expiring provisions of the Patriot Act, Jeff Flake successfully submitted several amendments to the bill in the House of Representatives. One required the FBI director to personally sign off on any request for library and bookstore records before applying to the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, but it was altered in the United States Senate version of the bill. Two of his amendments were signed into law and they subjected any National Security Letter and its gag order to a judicial challenge by the recipient, and narrowed the scope of "Sneak and Peek" warrants to have definite time limits on their duration and extensions before they need to notify the target of the investigation. Before that, "Sneak and Peek" warrants could be extended by the standard of not "unduly delaying trial" without any defined time limitation. This amended bill was titled the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 and it was signed into law on March 9, 2006. This bill also required three Inspector General investigations that led to the discovery of exigent letters and National Security Letter abuses.

On February 8, 2011, Flake voted to renew key provisions of the USA PATRIOT ACT. The vote failed.On February 10, 2011 Jeff Flake again voted to renew key provisions of the USA PATRIOT ACT. This vote succeeded.

Committee assignments

	 Committee on Appropriations

	 Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies

	 Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies

	 Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies

He serves on the Liberty Committee (sometimes called the Liberty Caucus), a group of libertarian-leaning Republican congressmen. He is also a member of the Republican Study Committee.

U.S. Senate

2012 election

In February 2011, Flake announced that he was running for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by the retiring Senate Minority Whip Jon Kyl in 2012. Flake easily won the Republican nomination against real estate businessman Wil Cardon.

He faced former surgeon general Richard Carmona, who sought office for the first time in the general election. In May 2012, Flake led Carmona by 13 points in the polls. In an October 2012 poll by Public Policy Polling, Flake was trailing Carmona by two points. After the race tightened, the Wall Street Journal criticized a controversial Flake ad that accused Carmona of having "issues with anger, with ethics, and with women." 

Flake was endorsed by the Casa Grande Dispatch, the United States Chamber of Commerce, and the Club for Growth.

Flake defeated Democratic Richard Carmona 49%-46% on November 6, 2012.

Tenure

He replaced retiring Republican U.S. Senator Jon Kyl on January 3, 2013.

In March 2013, he joined with Senators Lindsey Graham, Mark Begich and Mark Pryor in introducing a bill that would close a loophole by flagging individuals who attempt to buy guns who have used an insanity defense, were ruled dangerous by a court, or had been committed by a court to mental health treatment.

On April 17, 2013, Flake joined 45 other senators in voting against the Manchin-Toomey Amendment, which would have required background checks on all commercial gun sales. Following the vote, Flake was criticized for changing his position on background checks. Just days before the vote, he had sent the mother of one of the Colorado theater shooting victims a hand-written letter stating that "strengthening background checks is something we agree on." In response to a question asking whether he was worried about potential political consequences vowed by gun-control groups, Flake replied, "That's the beauty of a 6-year term. I truly want to do something on this, but what has been a little upsetting is to hear people try to maintain that we were just caving to pressure, discounting any issues that we had with the legislation, with the language. That’s just not right." Since his no vote, Flake has seen his approval rating fall from 45%-43% to 32%-51% according to one poll, making him the most unpopular senator in America as of April 2013.

Although he voted in favor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) in 2007, which would have banned discrimination based on sexual orientation, Flake said he had concerns with the 2013 version, which includes both sexual orientation and gender identity. However, when the vote occurred on November 7, Flake cast his vote in favor of the 2013 version of ENDA.

In February 2014, Flake, along with Senator Pat Roberts, introduced the Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by the IRS Act. The bill would prohibit the IRS from passing a new rule that would limit non-profit groups' participation in the political process.

On July 16, 2013, Flake introduced the Stewardship Contracting Reauthorization and Improvement Act (S. 1300). The bill would give the federal government more authority to enter into agreements known as "forest stewardship contracts." The goal, according to Flake, is to reduce the risk of forest wildfires. In December 2013, the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources recommended, by a voice vote, that the Senate pass the legislation.

Environment

Bill Williams River Water Rights Settlement Act

On December 2, 2014, the Senate passed the Bill Williams River Water Rights Settlement Act. The bill would put an end to a fight over water rights in the Bill Williams River Watershed in Arizona. Flake introduced the Senate version of the bill along with Senator John McCain. The bill also helps the Hualapai native American tribe, which uses water from the watershed. If the bill is signed by President Obama, it would put a limit on the amount of water that a local mining company can use, and it would give legal recognition to the tribe's rights to the water source.

Flake introduced a Senate companion bill, S.2503 - Bill Williams River Water Rights Settlement Act of 2014, on June 19, 2014. On July 9, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs held a hearing on the bill. On December 8, the House bill was presented to President Obama for his signature. The bill had unanimous approval by both houses of Congress.

At a House hearing on the bill in September 2014, in which both the Hualapai Tribe and Freeport Minerals company testified, both the tribe and the company agreed that the bill would provide each, and other interests, with benefits. The settlement would guarantee water rights for the tribe; provide water for Freeport's mine in Bagdad, Arizona; and give the state of Arizona rights to a property area that would be used for a conservation program for several species. The Arizona Chamber of Commerce supported the legislation, saying, "The settlement of water rights claims is a priority in our state in order to provide clarity and long-term certainty to all water users across Arizona."

EPA waterways regulation

In 2014, the EPA announced that it would make some changes to federal regulation of water. Two different cases that went before the Supreme Court resulted in the court ordering the EPA to specify which waterways in the U.S. are considered protected by the Clean Water Act. Flake and Senator McCain sent a letter to the head of the EPA, citing a number of reasons why the regulation would hurt Arizona. One of the senators' concerns was about waterways that only flow in certain parts of the year. Flake and McCain believe that if the EPA includes those types of waterways in the new regulations, the regulations would have a negative effect on Arizona's agriculture industry. One of the reasons the EPA is using in deciding which waterways will fall under the new regulation is by concluding whether pollution in waterways will negatively affect other waters downstream. Flake and McCain asserted in their letter that little proof existed to back up such a conclusion, but the EPA responded by saying that the proposed regulation was carefully examined and was made with bipartisan input. Additionally, Flake and McCain wrote that the new changes could make it harder for Arizona firefighters to fight wildfires.

On October 1, 2014, the Small Business Administration wrote a letter to the EPA expressing concern about the impact the rule would have on small businesses, saying, "We believe that EPA and the Corps have improperly certified the proposed rule under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) because it would have direct, significant effects on small businesses." The SBA letter concluded by saying that the EPA rule would be potentially costly for small businesses, and asked the EPA to withdraw the rule altogether.

Flake advocated against the rule for two primary reasons. First, Flake wrote that the EPA proposed rule did not make a distinction between waterways that flow all year or just part of the year. Flake cited that 94 percent of Arizona's waterways do not flow continuously year-round, and because of that, the lack of distinction in the rule would affect most of Arizona's waterways. Second, Flake argued that the scientific evidence used by the EPA to back up the rule was "anything but settled." Flake and McCain warned the EPA administrator about their concerns earlier in the year, via a letter sent on May 6, 2014.

An editorial published by the Arizona Republic said that the EPA rule would have the effect of requiring the CAP Canal to treat drinking water twice, which would increase costs to Arizona residents. The editorial claims that the canal, and all water sources that go to people's homes, already has to meet Safe Drinking Water Act regulations.

Flake report: The Science of Splurging

In December 2014, Flake published a 22-page report titled "The Science of Splurging: Wasteful Grants & Egregious Spending at the EPA." The report provided 17 case examples of spending by the EPA that Flake characterized as wasteful. Among the examples Flake used were employees who were paid but didn't show up for work for years; the case of John Beale, an EPA employee who convinced his coworkers that he was a CIA spy (and is now in prison); and credit card charges by EPA employees. In his opening letter in the report, Flake admits that some of the blame for the spending can be placed on Congress, citing that Congress has not executed the normal appropriations process in recent years, which Flake says would have resulted in more careful scrutiny of federal budgets.

Environmental Defense Fund

 Senators McCain and Flake: Thanks for putting politics aside to support clean air for our kids. Environmental Defense FundJuly 25, 2013 In July 2013, the Environmental Defense Fund aired a TV commercial titled "Thanks for putting politics aside to support clean air for our kids", which thanked Senator Flake for voting to confirm Gina McCarthy as the new administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.

Immigration

When Flake is asked by reporters about his feelings on immigration, Flake responds by talking about his childhood. He grew up on a working farm. Migrant laborers were employees, and Flake also spent time working. "I've never been able to view those who come here to work as a criminal class," he told a Washington Post reporter during an interview.

Flake was a member of a group of eight senators, who were from both the Democratic and Republican parties, that sponsored an immigration overhaul bill. In 2013, the Senate passed the bill with 68 votes (a vote-proof margin). Flake described why he believed that it had been possible to create a bipartisan group of senators to address immigration problems. He said that a big enough group of congressional members from both parties wanting to fix immigration system existed, even though there are many people on both sides of the political aisle who do not sincerely want to solve immigration issues. Flake said, "And that’s what made the Gang of Eight work. Pretty quickly we determined that everybody around that table wanted to do this. We weren’t looking to score political points."

When in November 2014, President Obama announced on TV that he would use his executive powers to allow some undocumented immigrants remain in the United States, Flake told some reporters outside of the Senate chamber that the best response would be not to shut down the government, but to pass a bill that addresses immigration problems. As for Obama's executive plan, Flake said that he opposed it.Flake opposed using a government funding bill to stop President Obama's executive action, but Flake also said that he believed that both party’s strategies (the executive action vs. the threat of shutting down the government) would make it more difficult to pass immigration reform legislation.

Flake has publicly said that he believes that the reason so many children in recent years have come across the U.S. border illegally without parents is because parents believe their children will be able to stay in the United States if they do so.

Flake has said that the Republican Party needs to take a rational approach to solving immigration problems, and if it does not, the party will have a difficult time winning national elections (like the presidency). Flake said that Jeb Bush's support of an immigration system reform makes Bush more electable in a general election. Flake supported Jeb Bush's remarks about immigration being an act of love, and said, "Growing up here in Arizona, I’ve seen what motivates those who come here illegally. Sure, some come with the intent to do harm or simply to take advantage of our generosity. But many come to find work to feed their families. To lump everyone who crosses the border illegally into the same class is unfair and unproductive."

In January 2015, Flake re-introduced the Immigration Innovation Act (“I-Squared”), a bill first introduced in 2013, co-sponsoring with Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and Chris Coons (D-DE). The bill increases the annual cap on H-1B visas from 65,000 to 115,000, “authorizes employment for the dependent spouses of H-1B visas holders, and allows a grace period for foreign workers to change jobs and not be out of status, allows for the recapturing issuing of green cards that 'were approved by Congress in previous years but were not used'", and refers to “persons with extraordinary ability,” and “outstanding professors and researchers” to create an unlimited green card cap. Opposition to the bill comes as the high-tech industry, like Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg’s FWD.us lobbying group, has pushed for increases in guest-worker permits. A group of four scholars challenged the high tech claims of an American workers shortage, and Breitbart News stated, "'Despite evidence to the contrary, the tech industry has spent millions trying to get massive increases in the number of H-1b guest-worker visas, claiming that they "can’t find" Americans to do various tech jobs' even though there is a proven surplus of America high-tech workers."

Foreign policy

In a speech before the Council on Foreign Relations in September 2014, Flake described his guiding principles in foreign policy and what he believes should be the three major goals for foreign policy: protect American interests by reinforcing American leadership abroad; promote and support the principles of liberty and the democratic process; and serve as good stewards of taxpayer dollars by eliminating wasteful spending in foreign policy programs. Flake believes that any U.S. president should get the support of Congress when undertaking a major foreign policy action because, as Flake said, "Our position in the world has never been stronger when Congress and the President present a united front.” On the issue of foreign aid, Flake believes that it is a critical component of diplomacy, but it can undermine America's diplomatic efforts when the aid is wasteful.

Cuba

Flake supported President Barack Obama's 2014 decision to begin the process of normalizing relations between the United States and Cuba, despite opposition to the policy change from other Republican senators. Flake joined Democrats Chris Van Hollen and Patrick Leahy on a trip to Cuba to return Alan Gross to the United States. Gross, an American aid worker, had been imprisoned in Cuba for five years, but was released as part of the agreement between Obama and Cuban leader Raúl Castro. Flake believes that the United States embargo against Cuba is flawed, stating, “The policy that we’ve had in place for the past 50 years has done more in my view … to keep the Castro regimes in power than anything we could’ve done.” Flake has traveled to Cuba nine times and supports loosening restrictions on Americans traveling to Cuba.

Islamic State

Flake believes that President Obama should ask Congress to vote to support military action against the Islamic State, commonly known as ISIS or ISIL. He believes that a congressional vote of approval would send a message to ISIS and other American enemies that the United States is united in its fight against the groups.

In a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on September 17, 2014, during testimony from Secretary of State John Kerry, Flake told Kerry that he “questioned whether it was a wise move” when President Obama asked Congress for authorization to use force against Syria after chemical weapons were used in Syria in 2013. During the discussion, Flake and Kerry agreed that they wanted a strong effort with allies to combat ISIS. The difference between the two centered around what Flake believed to be an inconsistency in the administration’s approach to Congress between the Syrian chemical weapons situation and the more current situation against ISIS.

Veterans

Flake and Senators McCain, Tom Coburn and Richard Burr introduced a veterans reform bill called the Veterans Choice Act on June 3, 2014. The bill was drafted in response to the Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014.

Under the legislation:

	 If a Veterans' Affairs (VA) medical facility makes a veteran wait too long, then the veteran is allowed to go get medical care somewhere else.

	 If a veteran lives more than 40 miles from a VA medical facility, then the veteran is allowed to get medical care somewhere else.

	 The VA must promptly pay its bills, like all other agencies have to.

	 The VA must put more details about its doctors on its website. For example, the VA currently has a webpage called “Our Providers” that shows education and board certifications of doctors. It does not, however, show where the doctor trained in residency. The bill would change that and require the residency information to be displayed.

	 VA hospitals must give information about a surgeon to a veteran scheduled for surgery.

	 VA has the power to demote senior executives who don’t do a good job.

Outside veterans groups that have publicly supported the bill include the American Legion, Concerned Veterans for America, AMVETS, and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.

A House-sponsored version of the bill, H.R. 3230, was signed by President Obama and became Public Law 113-146 on August 7, 2014.

Education bill

In 2013, Flake and Senator John McCain (R- AZ) sponsored a bill, S. 2863 - the Transparency in Education Act. According to Flake, the bill would affect the Department of Education’s gainful employment rule.

The gainful employment rule is a regulation proposed by the United States Department of Education. “Gainful employment programs” are a type of postsecondary education requirement to prepare students for employment in a “recognized occupation.” In return, schools that meet the criteria can be eligible to offer students federal financial aid programs.

The Flake-McCain bill would require the Department of Education to investigate how the rule would affect students at all colleges and universities. When the officials initially proposed the rule, they targeted the rule at for-profit institutions.

Bipartisan survival trip

Flake used his experience surviving in the wild for six days with a Democratic Senator to develop an idea to end partisan gridlock in Washington. Flake and U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-NM) were featured on a Discovery Channel reality TV show, Rival Survival, where the two stayed on a small Micronesian island for six days. Flake later joked during a speech at the National Press Club that sending both Senate leaders (Majority Leader Senator Harry Reid D-NV and Republican Mitch McConnell R-KY) to a remote island together might reduce bipartisanship and allow more legislation to move forward.

Personal life

Flake and his wife Cheryl live in Mesa and have five children. They are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He spent time in Zimbabwe and South Africa as a Mormon missionary. The Flakes have been married since ca. 1985.

His uncle, Jake Flake, was an Arizona state senator.

While serving as a Representative, Flake spent a week alone on the island of Jabonwod, one of the Marshall Islands, as a survivalist venture. He survived by of eating crabs, coconuts, and fish.  Having enjoyed the experience, he decided to repeat it when he was a senator, this time bringing his two youngest sons with him to another island in the area, Biggarenn, for four days during a congressional recess.
