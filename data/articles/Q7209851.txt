Chao Sze-Tsung Cecil (, born 1936) is a Hong Kong billionaire who is the owner of Cheuk Nang Holdings Ltd.

He is widely noted for his claim to have slept with 10,000 women. He had children by three of them: actresses Kelly Yao Wei (mother of Gigi, below) and Ying Ying, and model Terri Holladay.

In 2012 Chao gained international attention when he offered $65 million to any man who could convince his lesbian daughter, Gigi, to marry him. Despite criticism, Cecil Chao remains unrepentant. In 2014 Cecil Chao increased his offer to $80 million to the man who would marry his daughter. Gigi responded publicly in an open letter printed in the South China Morning Post. They note that despite Gigi marrying her partner of nine years, Sean Eav, in a civil ceremony in France in 2012, her father still considers her single. She wrote, in part, "With Sean, a woman, I am comfortable and satisfied with my life â€¦ I know it's difficult for you to understand how I could feel romantically attracted to a woman; I suppose I can't really explain it either. It just happens, peacefully and gently, and after so many years, we still love each other very much. My regret is that you have no idea how happy I am with my life, and there are aspects of my life that you don't share. I suppose we don't need each other's approval for our romantic relationships, and I am sure your relationships are really fantastic too. Now, I'm not asking you to be best of friends; however, it would mean the world to me if you could just not be so terrified of her, and treat her like a normal, dignified human being."
