Sarah Lancaster (born February 12, 1980) is an American actress. She is known for her long-running roles as Rachel Meyers in the NBC series Saved by the Bell: The New Class and Ellie Bartowski in the NBC comedy-spy series Chuck, as well as playing Madison Kellner on The WB's Everwood and Marjorie in ABC's TV series What About Brian.

Life and career

Lancaster was born and raised in Overland Park, Kansas, with a younger brother, Daniel. As a teenager, her parents, Barbara and Michael, relocated to Mission Viejo, California, where Sarah took up film/TV acting classes with R. J. Adams at The Actors Workshop.

Her skill impressed a talent agent, who helped the then-eighth grader to secure her first series-regular role on Saved by the Bell: The New Class in 1993. During this time, she was tutored on the set and took college courses at the University of California, Irvine to expedite her graduation from high school, after which she moved to Los Angeles to further her acting career.

She has appeared on Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, Dawson's Creek, That '70s Show, Scrubs, and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. She also landed two recurring roles: on The WB series, Everwood, as Ephram's love interest Madison Kellner; and on David E. Kelley's FOX series, Boston Public. In 2005 she starred in the TV movie Living With the Enemy. Most notably, she appeared as Ellie Bartowski Woodcomb on the NBC series Chuck from 2007 to 2012.

Lancaster has also worked as a jealous girlfriend-turned-serial killer in the movie Lovers Lane, and as the blackjack dealer, Veronica Harold, on CBS's short-lived Dr. Vegas.

Personal life

Lancaster is married to attorney Matthew Jacobs. She gave birth to their son Oliver Michael on June 29, 2011.
