Bryan Colangelo (born June 1, 1965) is the former President and General Manager of the Toronto Raptors of the NBA. He is the son of Phoenix sports mogul, Jerry Colangelo. He graduated from Cornell University with a bachelor of science degree in business management and applied economics. He was the 2005 and 2007 recipient of the NBA Executive of the Year Award.

Front Office career

Phoenix

Bryan began his NBA front-office career with the Phoenix Suns, a franchise then owned by his father. He was a part of that organization for 15 years, the last 11 as General Manager. 

During his tenure in Phoenix, Colangelo made a number of transactions that have received wide praise across the NBA, including the drafting of would-be superstars Shawn Marion and Amar'e Stoudemire. Colangelo was roundly criticized for his trade of Jason Kidd to the New Jersey Nets for Stephon Marbury, but corrected this mistake by trading Marbury and oft-injured Penny Hardaway to the New York Knicks for several contracts.  The additional salary cap space created by this trade allowed Colangelo to sign Steve Nash back from the Dallas Mavericks in the summer of 2004.  Nash would go on to be the 2004-05 and 2005-06 NBA Most Valuable Player, and the Suns would go 62-20 and claim the top playoff seed in the Western Conference in the 2004-05 season.  As a result, Colangelo was awarded the 2005 NBA Executive of the Year Award.

In the summer of 2005, Colangelo traded disgruntled shooting guard Joe Johnson to the Atlanta Hawks for two future first-round picks and Boris Diaw, who then won the 2006 NBA Most Improved Player Award. Colangelo also dealt Quentin Richardson to the New York Knicks. Despite the loss of these two players and the loss of Stoudemire for virtually the entire season (only playing in 3 regular season games), the Suns once again led the Pacific Division.

In addition to his work with the Suns, he served as president of Phoenix Arena Sports (PAS), the owning entity of the Arizona Rattlers Arena Football League team and the operating entity of the Phoenix Mercury WNBA team from June 1991 through June 2002. The Rattlers won the championship in 1994 and 1997 and the Mercury played in the WNBA finals in 1998. He won the AFL Executive of the Year award in 1993 for his work with the Rattlers.

Toronto

In 2004, the Suns were sold to a group of investors led by Robert Sarver, although Colangelo stayed on as President and GM. Shortly after the Raptors fired Rob Babcock in January 2006, rumors began swirling that the team was pursuing Colangelo despite the Raptors' claims that they were initiating an "exhaustive" search for a new GM. 

On February 27, 2006, Colangelo resigned from his position with the Suns, and on February 28, 2006, the Raptors announced him as their new President and GM. On May 23, 2006, Colangelo and the Raptors were awarded the first overall pick in the 2006 NBA Draft.

On June 8, 2006, Colangelo pulled his first trade since he joined the Raptors by swapping the much-criticized first-rounder Rafael Araújo for Robert Whaley and Kris Humphries with the Utah Jazz. He completed his second trade by sending forward Eric Williams, fan favorite Matt Bonner and a 2009 second-round pick to the San Antonio Spurs for center Rasho Nesterovič on June 21, 2006. The Raptors also announced that they had waived Robert Whaley.

His first major trade as GM of the Raptors occurred when he traded Charlie Villanueva, who was runner-up for the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, for Milwaukee Bucks point guard T. J. Ford. Some believed that Villanueva's presence hindered the development of Chris Bosh, who was considered to be the new franchise player of the Toronto Raptors following the departure of Vince Carter. But Colangelo specified that the team was in need of a true point guard, and in order to receive a quality point guard in T.J. Ford, one must also give up a lot in return, hence the trade took place the way it did.

Colangelo picked the 20-year-old Italian Andrea Bargnani with the first overall selection in the 2006 NBA Draft which was held in New York City on June 28, 2006. This made Bargnani the first European selected first overall in the history of the NBA Draft. He also signed several free agents from European teams, including Jorge Garbajosa and Anthony Parker.

On July 16, 2006, Colangelo signed Bosh to a contract extension which was in effect starting from the 2007 - 08 season. The contract was for three years plus a player option for the fourth year, and had the potential to pay Bosh up to US$65 million over the four-year span.

2007: Executive of the Year

In 2007 the Raptors clinched the Atlantic Division for the first time in franchise history. Many have credited their significant turnaround from a 27 - 55 2005-06 season to the changes made by Colangelo, in which he brought in nine new players to the Toronto Raptors' roster.

Colangelo was awarded the 2007 Executive of the Year Award in the weeks following the Raptors' series loss to the Nets in the first round of the playoffs.

During the offseason, Colangelo gave the 2009 and 2011 second-round draft picks to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for Carlos Delfino. He also signed Jason Kapono to a multi-year contract with the Raptors.

2008-2013

On July 6, 2008, Colangelo traded point guard T.J. Ford to the Indiana Pacers, for Jermaine O'Neal. The Raptors also earned the draft rights to forward-center Nathan Jawai, the 41st overall selection in the 2008 NBA Draft, from the Indiana Pacers, and sent center Rasho Nesterovic, forward Maceo Baston and the draft rights to center Roy Hibbert to the Pacers. During the 2008-2009 season, the trade was regarded as being a failure for Toronto.

Colangelo fired coach Sam Mitchell 17 games into the season, promoting assistant Jay Triano to head coach. Triano was the first Canadian-born head coach in NBA history.

On May 21, 2013, MLSE announced that the Raptors were looking for a new GM, but Colangelo would remain team President.

On June 26, 2013, Colangelo stepped down as President of the Raptors.

Personal life

Before working for the Phoenix Suns, Colangelo worked for an upmarket commercial real estate firm on Wall Street for four years. Colangelo is married to Italian-born Barbara Bottini and they have two children, son Mattia and daughter Sofia.

As of January 2015, Colangelo resides in Yorkville, Toronto with his family, and is in the final stages of earning his permanent residency in Canada. After his tenure with the Toronto Raptors ended, Colangelo has been doing freelance scouting and consulting for other NBA executives and agents.
