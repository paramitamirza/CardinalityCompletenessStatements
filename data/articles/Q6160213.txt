Jari Sarasvuo (born Jari Heinonen on 12 June 1965 in Turku) is the founder, chief owner and CEO of Trainer's House, a Finnish company that arranges training and lectures particularly for marketing topics.

Sarasvuo has worked as an editor and chief editor in several magazines and also in Helsinki's Radio City. His first publicity was as a host in a talk show on the Finnish channel MTV3 in the 1990s. After leaving jobs in television, he has worked as a lecturer and as a motivational coach, also publishing six books on the same topic. One of his famous concepts is the "inner hero" (sisäinen sankari), and he has also coined the term huomiotalous ("attention economy"), describing the central role of publicity in the today's economy.

Sarasvuo owns about a third of Trainer's House, and if evaluated, the stock is valued at some 34 million euros (January 2008). He has also contributed to charity in the form of providing microcredit and taking part in a project to support Bangladeshi women to become entrepreneurs.
