Thomas Walter Bickett (February 28, 1869December 28, 1921) was the 54th Governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1917 to 1921. He was born in Monroe, North Carolina.

Bickett was a graduate of Wake Forest College. Prior to being elected Governor, Bickett practiced law in Louisburg, represented Franklin County in the North Carolina General Assembly and then served as North Carolina Attorney General for two terms (1909-1917). 

In 1916, Bickett became the first state governor who was nominated by means of a Democratic Party primary election (in which he defeated Lt. Gov. Elijah L. Daughtridge). Under Bickett's leadership, the state saw improvements in child welfare, public health, electricity, and running water. He persuaded the legislature to establish the state's first income tax. He also had to lead the state through World War I.

Walter Bickett Elementary in Monroe, NC (where he was born) is named for him.
