Jelena Karleuša Tošić (Јелена Карлеуша Тошић; born 17 August 1978), professionally known under her maiden name Jelena Karleuša, is a Serbian pop recording artist, television personality, former columnist and a human rights activist. Today, she is one of the most popular singers on Balkan, selling millions of albums within the area. She rose to fame with her debut album Ogledalce (1995), and has since gained popularity in all of the former Yugoslavia. She is married to football player, Duško Tošić, with whom she has two daughters.

Early and personal life

Jelena Karleuša was born in Yugoslavia's capital city Belgrade to Serb father Dragan (born 1 January 1947), a senior police officer, and Slovene-Serb mother Divna (born 25 January 1957). Her maternal grandfather Jurij (died 1967 in plane crash) was from Ptuj, Slovenia and her maternal grandmother Darinka (died 2004) was from Doboj, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Karleuša was born and raised in Fontana, a neighborhood of Novi Beograd, Belgrade, Serbia. 

Career

She began her singing career as a singer in the mid-90s and gained popularity with her debut album, Ogledalce (1995), selling more than 10,000 copies in Serbia and Montenegro. Later, she started singing pop music exclusively. She has since had several #1 hits, most of which were written by Marina Tucaković. Jelena has released ten studio albums, which charted in Serbia, Montenegro and neighboring countries such as Croatia, Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina Bulgaria and Greece.

Karleuša's single, "Insomnia", featuring Mirza Hamzić, was downloaded 1.5 million times from her website, just a day after its official premiere on 30 December 2009, the final night of the reality show Big Brother. "Insomnia" became the third most viewed video on YouTube, with over four million viewers for two weeks. The video was later deleted from her Youtube channel, but later re-uploaded.

Her jubilee tenth studio album Diva was released on 11 June 2012. The record sold over 200.000 copies during the day of its release, becoming one of the fastest selling albums ever on Balkan and the fastest album to be certified gold. 

Ten months after the release of Diva, Karleuša performed guest vocals on Ferrari, a single by Karleuša's Krimi rad collaborators Teča and Nesh.

Karleuša gained international fame because of her style, shown in her Instagram photos. With more than 700 thousand followers, she is the most followed account on Balkans.

Personal life

Karleuša married Bojan Karić, the son of Serbian businessman Bogoljub Karić, in 2004. They divorced after two months. On 29 June 2008, Karleuša married Serbian football player Duško Tošić. On 7 September 2008, she gave birth to their first daughter, Atina, named after the Greek goddess Athena. Their second daughter, Nika, was born on 7 September 2009, and named after the Greek goddess of victory Nika.

In 2010, Karleuša began writing her own column for the Serbian newspaper Kurir, in which she criticized Serbian celebrities such as politicians Boris Tadić, Čedomir Jovanović and Ivica Dačić, and singers Lepa Brena and Ceca. She stopped writing it in November 2010 as she was "afraid for her own security". Her column drew criticism, with some people stating she was just trying to draw attention. Karleuša is known for supporting LGBT persons and has received numerous awards as a gay icon. In its November 2013 issue, W magazine featured Karleuša in an article about pop stars outside the United States.

During a February 2013 interview on a television show she revealed that in 1997, in the backstage of Minimaks's talk show Minimaksovizija, Minimaks was assaulted by Serbian criminal Željko Ražnatović when he defended Karleuša after Ražnatović claimed that every Serbian singer was a "whore".

Other activities

In 2006, Karleuša launched her own fashion brand, named JK Wear. The collection included dresses and other accessories. In 2010, she was guest star on the reality show Big Brother All Stars VP for two days. The same year, it was rumoured Karleuša would start her political career, as she openly supported the ideas of Zoran Đinđić and Čedomir Jovanović.

In 2015, Karleuša accused Kim Kardashian of copying her fashion style, citing several outfits that are similar. Recently The Wendy Williams Show also showed Beyoncé wearing very similar looks that Karleuša wore a few months before.

In September 2015, Karleuša became a member of the jury in the music talent show program "Grand Stars".
