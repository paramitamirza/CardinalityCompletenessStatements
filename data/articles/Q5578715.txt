Jean-Benoît "J. B." Blanc (born 13 February 1969) is a French-English actor and voice actor.

Early life

Blanc was born in Paris, the son of a French father and English mother. He moved to England with his mother at the age of five, where he was educated at Bramcote School in Scarborough, North Yorkshire and Sedbergh School in Sedbergh, Cumbria. At the age of 16, he successfully auditioned for the National Youth Theatre. In 1987, he was accepted at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), the youngest person to do so that year. He graduated in 1990 and, after a short sabbatical travelling, began his theatre career.

Career

At one time, Blanc ran his own theatre company and was working with companies on the London scene, collaborating with directors such as Rufus Norris, Howard Davies, and Sir Peter Hall at the Royal National Theatre. In 2001, after 12 years almost exclusively working in theatre, he played the Luigi Vampa in the 2002 film The Count of Monte Cristo. Since moving to the United States, he has appeared in television series such as Breaking Bad, Cold Case, CSI: New York, Raising the Bar, The Unit, Crash, NYPD Blue, Prison Break, Dr. Vegas, and The Company.

Blanc has also appeared in films such as The Incredible Hulk, Tristan & Isolde, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties and Moonlight Serenade. He has done voice-overs commercially and in animation and video games such as Dante's Inferno, Darksiders, Wildstar, and 007: From Russia with Love, in which he played Turkish agent Kerim Bey. In 2013, Blanc voiced various characters in Saints Row IV, including Emperor Zinyak and Phillipe Loren. He voiced Commander Blisk in the 2014 video game Titanfall.

Personal life

Blanc lives in Los Angeles, California with his daughter, Malia.
