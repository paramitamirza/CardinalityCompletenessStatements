The Kenyan Parliamentary Accounts Committee found that the Devolution ministry, where she served as a Cabinet Secretary, spent KSh450,000 ($4500) for 18 custom-made condom dispensers. The ministry's asset register also revealed Sh1.7 million ($17000) was spent for an HD television set in Anne Waiguru's office and Sh12 million ($120000) for an office partition, in the 2013/2014 financial year.

In a rejoinder to the allegations, Waiguru claimed that the allegations made against her were personal attacks and pointed out that corruption is endemic in other ministries in the Kenyan government but the media was not pointing it out. She said in a post posted on her Facebook page: "It's amazing that whereas there are similar and more serious allegations of misuse of funds in many government departments there is never the personalized level of attack on CSs that has been directed at me. Surely this is no longer about the fight against corruption".
