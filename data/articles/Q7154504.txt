Career

Hoskisson has taught at BYU since 1981. Before that he taught at the University of Zurich and worked at the University of TÃ¼bingen.  Hoskisson has also served as Fulbright Program adviser at BYU.

Hoskisson is a member of several professional academic associations, including the Society of Biblical Literature, the American Oriental Society, the American Schools of Oriental Research, and the Mormon History Association.  He has served on the board of trustees for the American Schools of Oriental Research.

Hoskisson has published research on the Book of Mormon, the Old Testament, and other LDS subjects. For example, he wrote about pre-600 B.C. scimitars in the Middle East, thus making their presence possible among Lehi and his descendants in the new world in ways that were previously denied.  Hoskisson edited Historicity and the Latter-day Saints, an anthology by BYU's Religious Studies Center, in which he contributed a paper on the need for historicity. He also contributed several articles to FARMS' Journal of Book of Mormon Studies that explore possible ancient meanings behind names in the Book of Mormon.

In September 2008, Hoskisson was appointed the director of FARMS and BYU's Laura F. Willes Center for Book of Mormon Research.
