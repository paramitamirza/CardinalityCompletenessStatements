Having long desired to become a performer, Egan spent most of her time taking dancing and singing lessons as a child. She remarks she took a lot of ballet as she heard it would help with all forms of performing.

While attending Los Alamitos High School, the Orange County High School of the Arts, and the UCLA, she started her career touring with the performance group the Young Americans.

She sings with symphonies as well; she performed in concert at the Walt Disney Concert Hall with the Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles in November 2004.
