Albert Friedrich Speer, (May 6, 1863 - March 31, 1947) was a German architect. He was the father of the architect and NSDAP minister Albert Speer and the grandfather of the architect Albert Speer, Jr.

After studies in Berlin and Munich, he started an architecture firm in Mannheim, which he ran between 1900 and 1923.  His buildings are in the classical style and art nouveau. Most of his works are in Mannheim and are stylistically influenced by Art Nouveau and Neoclassical architecture.

His marriage to Luise Mathilde Wilhelmine Hommel produced three sons, among them Albert Speer. The painter Conrad Hommel was his brother-in-law, whose daughter Eva van Hoboken is his niece.
