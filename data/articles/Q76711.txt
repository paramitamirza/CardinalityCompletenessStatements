She enjoyed her worldwide breakthrough with Stay As You Are (1978), then came to global prominence with her Golden Globe Award-winning performance as the title character in the Roman Polanski-directed film Tess (1979). Other notable films in which she acted include the erotic horror Cat People (1982), two Wim Wenders dramas Paris, Texas (1984) and Faraway, So Close! (1993), and An American Rhapsody (2001).

Early life

She was born in Berlin as Nastassja Aglaia Nakszynski, Kinski is the daughter of the German actor Klaus Kinski and his wife, actress Ruth Brigitte Tocki. She is of part Polish descent. Kinski has two half-siblings; Pola and Nikolai Kinski. Her parents divorced in 1968. After the age of ten, Kinski rarely saw her father. Her mother struggled financially to support them. They eventually lived in a commune in Munich.

In a 1999 interview, Kinski denied that her father had sexually molested her as a child, but said he had abused her "in other ways." In 2013, when interviewed about the allegations of sexual abuse made by her half-sister Pola Kinski, she confirmed that he tried with her, but did not succeed. She said:

Career

Kinski began working as a model as a teenager in Germany. Actress Lisa Kreuzer of the German New Wave helped get her the role of the dumb Mignon in Wim Wenders film The Wrong Move. In 1976, while still a teenager, Kinski had her first two major roles: in Wolfgang Petersen's feature-film length episode Reifezeugnis of the German TV crime series Tatort. Next she appeared in the British horror film To the Devil a Daughter (1976), produced by Hammer Film Productions. In regards to her early films, Kinski has stated that she felt exploited by the industry. In an interview with W magazine she said, "If I had had somebody to protect me or if I had felt more secure about myself, I would not have accepted certain things. Nudity things. And inside it was just tearing me apart."

In 1978, Kinski starred in the Italian romance Stay As You Are (Cosi come sei) with Marcello Mastroianni, gaining her recognition in the United States after New Line Cinema released it there in December 1979. Time magazine wrote that she was "simply ravishing, genuinely sexy and high-spirited without being painfully aggressive about it."  The film also received a major international release from Columbia Pictures.

Kinski met the director Roman Polanski at a party in 1976. He urged her to study method acting with Lee Strasberg in the United States and she was offered the title role in Polanski's upcoming film, Tess (1979). In 1978, Kinski undergone extensive preparation for the portrayal of English peasant girl, which included acquiring Dorset accent through elocution studies: The film was nominated for six awards, including Best Picture, at the 53rd Academy Awards and won three.

In 1981, Richard Avedon photographed Kinski with a Burmese python coiled around her nude body. The image, which first appeared in the October 1981 issue of US Vogue, was released as a poster and became a best-seller, further confirming her status as a sex symbol.

In 1982, she starred in Francis Ford Coppola's romantic musical One from the Heart, her first film made in the United States. Texas Monthly described her as acting "as a Felliniesque circus performer to represent the twinkling evanescence of Eros." The film failed at the box office and was a major loss for Coppola's new Zoetrope Studios. That year, she was also in the erotic horror movie Cat People. Dudley Moore's comedy Unfaithfully Yours and an adaptation of John Irving's The Hotel New Hampshire followed in 1984.

Kinski reteamed with Wenders for the 1984 film Paris, Texas. One of her most acclaimed films to date, it won the top award at the Cannes Film Festival. Throughout the 1980s, Kinski split her time between Europe and the United States, making Moon in the Gutter (1983), Harem (1985) and Torrents of Spring (1989) in Europe, and Exposed (1983), Maria's Lovers (1984) and Revolution (1985) in the United States.

During the 1990s, Kinski appeared in a number of American films including the action movie Terminal Velocity, opposite Charlie Sheen; the Mike Figgis 1997 adultery tale One Night Stand; Your Friends & Neighbors (1998); John Landis' Susan's Plan (1998); and The Lost Son (1999).

Her most recent films include David Lynch's Inland Empire (2006) and Rotimi Rainwater's Sugar (2013).

Personal life

In 2001, Kinski revealed that she suffered from narcolepsy in an interview for the The Daily Telegraph.

Relationships

In 1976, when Kinski was 15, she reportedly began a romantic relationship with then 43-year-old director Roman Polanski. In a 1999 Guardian interview, the newspaper reports her saying there was categorically no affair and that she said "There was a flirtation. There could have been a seduction, but there was not. He had respect for me."

Marriage and children

In the mid-1980s Kinski met the Egyptian filmmaker Ibrahim Moussa. They married on 10 September 1984. They have two children together; a son Aljosha (born 1984), and daughter Sonja Kinski (born 1986), who works as a model and actress. The marriage was dissolved in 1992. From 1992 until 1995 Kinski lived with musician Quincy Jones, though she kept her own apartment on Hilgard Avenue, near UCLA, at the time.
