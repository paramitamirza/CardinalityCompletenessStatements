Jessica June Rowe  (born 22 June 1970) is an Australian television news presenter who has worked on all three Australian commercial television networks.

Early life

Rowe attended Sydney Girls High School in Sydney, and completed a Communications degree at Charles Sturt University in Bathurst. During her studies she was a broadcaster with on-campus community radio station 2MCE-FM.

Career

At 22 years old, Rowe started her career at Channel Nine as a receptionist for Nine's Wide World of Sports.  She made her on-air debut as a weather presenter on Prime Television in Canberra.  She was later spotted by Network Ten executives, and was made a main news presenter. She presented Ten Sydney's flagship Ten News at Five bulletin with Ron Wilson for almost 10 years, from 1996 until the end of 2005.

Nine Network

In 2005, Rowe signed a contract valued at $500,000 to host the Nine Network's Today, which she briefly co-hosted with Karl Stefanovic from late January until early December 2006. Ten took Rowe to court over her defection, claiming that a clause in their contract with Rowe prevented her from starting at Nine until June 2006. The case was dismissed on 30 December 2005, allowing Rowe to debut on the show 30 January 2006. 

Rowe's early tenure with the Nine Network's Today was disastrous. There was public criticism of her presentation style on this breakfast television show, a style which was perceived by many as "annoying". Additionally, Rowe was embarrassed on 30 May 2006 by a gaffe in which Australian Brigadier Michael Slater revealed during a live cross that the interview from Dili, East Timor was being stage managed.  Nine Network CEO Eddie McGuire made a public statement in June 2006 falsely stating the claims Rowe was to be "sacked" were part of "a malicious and unprecedented vilification campaign" This followed the sworn evidence in an affidavit from Nine's former head of news Mark Llewellyn that McGuire had threatened to "bone" Jessica Rowe during a meeting with executives On 26 July 2006, she fell down six stairs at her Sydney home and suffered a broken wrist, but her unborn baby was uninjured. She went back to work on Today on the following Monday.

On 6 May 2007, it was announced that Rowe had left the Nine Network due to "payment disputes".

Seven Network

The Sydney Morning Herald had reported on 23 July that Rowe would return to television as a news presenter for Seven News. She was also a contestant in the seventh series of Dancing with the Stars.

From February 2008, Rowe began a stint as a panelist on a new late night show on Seven's high definition channel (7HD) called The NightCap.

On 15 December 2008, News Limited reported that Rowe's contract with the Seven Network had not been renewed. The head of the network, David Leckie, confirmed that her contract had ended and that Seven was unable to offer her a permanent news presenter position, although he said that casual news presenting shifts might become available for her.

In late 2010, Rowe was appointed news presenter on Weekend Sunrise, a role she held for almost three years.

In September 2013, Rowe resigned from the Seven Network.
