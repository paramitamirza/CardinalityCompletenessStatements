Frank Mackenzie Ross, CMG, MC (April 19, 1891 in Glasgow, Scotland - December 11, 1971 in Vancouver) was the 19th Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia.

Ross’ first job was as a bank clerk in Montreal in 1910. He joined the Canadian Army at the outbreak of World War I, serving with the 8th Battalion. During the war, Ross received the Military Cross and was a captain by the war’s end.

After the war, Ross joined a shipbuilding company in Saint John, New Brunswick. From this start, Ross went on to careers in industry and finance.

During World War II, Ross assisted in Ottawa procuring supplies for the British Admiralty. His wartime service earned Ross the C.M.G.. Also during the war, Ross married Phyllis Turner, whose son John Turner later became Prime Minister of Canada.

Ross was appointed as Lieutenant-Governor on October 3, 1955. During Ross’ term, a fire destroyed Government House. A new Government House was completed in May 1959, the year before Ross retired from the office of Lieutenant-Governor. With all of the furnishings destroyed, Frank Ross and his wife, Phyllis, went to the United Kingdom in search of suitable pieces. The Rosses purchased 114 pieces of furniture, which they donated to the new Government House.
