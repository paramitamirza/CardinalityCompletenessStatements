Biography

Legrand was born in Villa Cañás, a town in the province of Santa Fe located some 200 km from Rosario. Her parents were both Spanish immigrants, her father the owner of a bookstore and her mother a schoolteacher. In 1934 her parents separated. Her mother relocated to Rosario to ensure a better education for her three children, while her father remained in Villa Cañás.

In Rosario, with her twin sister Mirtha Legrand she took basic courses at the Municipal Theater. After the death of their father in 1936, the family relocated permanently to Buenos Aires, to the barrio of La Paternal. There they lived in poverty, mitigated by sporadic employment, until in 1939 the sisters were offered small roles in a film starring Niní Marshall which would be released in 1940 under the title Hay que educar a Niní.

The Legrand sisters' next film together was Novios para las muchachas in 1941. Mirtha's first leading role came later that year in Los martes, orquídeas. The same year her mother would be contacted by a well-known film industry figure, Ricardo Cerebello, who offered to represent the sisters. It was Cerebello who devised the stage names Mirtha and Silvia Legrand.

During the same period, Mirtha and Silvia hosted El club de la amistad for Radio Splendid.

In 1960 she appeared in the Antonio Cunill Jr. film Los Acusados.

Her last film was Juan Manuel de Rosas  in 1972 before she moved into television.
