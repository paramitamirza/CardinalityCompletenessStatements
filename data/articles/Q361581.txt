Ali Hassan Mwinyi (born May 8, 1925 in Kivure, Pwani Region, Tanzania was the Second President of the United Republic of Tanzania from 1985 - 1995.

Previous posts include Interior Minister and Vice President. He also was chairman of the ruling party, the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) from 1990 to 1996.

Presidency

During Mwinyi's terms Tanzania took the first steps to reverse the socialist policies of Julius Nyerere. He relaxed import restrictions and encouraged private enterprise. It was during his second term that multi-party politics were introduced under pressure from foreign donors. Often referred to as Mzee Rukhsa ("Everything goes"), he pushed for liberalization of morals, beliefs, values (without breaking the law) and the economy. He put these beliefs into practice by opposing religious fundamentalists who burned down pork butcheries; these were fanatics who claimed that eating pork contradicted their beliefs. He insisted that Tanzania was a free country and that individual freedom of beliefs was important. Many argue that during Mwinyi's tenure the country was in transition from the failed socialist orientation of Julius Nyerere that brought its economy to its knees. It was during Mwinyi's administration that Tanzania made some of the crucial decisions towards the liberalization of its economy that paved the way for short-term economic growth .

Personal life

Mwinyi married Sitti in 1960 and has six sons and six daughters. In retirement, Mwinyi has stayed out of the limelight and continues to live in Dar es Salaam.
