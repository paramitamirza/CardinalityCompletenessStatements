Running career

Wardian set the world record for fastest marathon while pushing a jogging stroller from May 2007 to November 2009. He set the record at the 2007 Frederick Marathon with a time of 2:42:21. The record was broken at a duel at the 2009 Route 66 marathon by Zac Freudenburg, whose 2:32:10 time beat Wardian's 2:34:37 time.

Wardian also was a former record holder of the fastest Marathon on a treadmill.  He qualified and participated in the 2004, 2008 and 2012 Men's Olympic Marathon trials.  Some of the notable ultra-marathons Wardian has completed include the Marathon des Sables, the Western States Endurance Run, the Himalayan 100 Mile Stage Race and the Vermont 100 Mile Endurance Run.  The United States Track and Field Association named Wardian the 2008 and 2009 Ultra Runner of the year.

In November 2009, Wardian finished third in the IAU World 50K championships held in Gibraltar.  In 2010, Wardian finished third at the Marathon des Sables in 23 hours 1 minute 3 seconds, which was the best time ever by an American.  In February 2011, the International Association of Ultrarunners named Wardian its inaugural Athlete of the Year.

On July 1, 2010, Wardian set the record for fastest indoor 200-meter track marathon record, with a time of 2:27:21. He qualified for the 2012 U.S. Olympic Marathon trials by running a 2:17:49 at the 2011 Grandma's Marathon.  In September 2011, he won the silver medal at the World 100K Championships.

In January 2012, Wardian ran 2:21 at the US Olympic Trials in Houston on Saturday January 14, and 2:31 at the Houston Marathon the next morning. He finished 62nd at the Trials and 16th at the Marathon.

In May 2014 he won the Wings For Life World Run in Sunrise running 57.75 km and finished 27th globally. In 2015 he chose to compete in Melbourne winning the race with 70.66 km to be the 10th of the world.

When asked in April 2009 why he competes in so many races, Wardian said:

A lot of people say, "Oh, you could be a 2:12 guy or a 2:14 guy if you just focused on one race a year, or two races a year and really built up." And I think the counter argument is that you could get hurt and you wouldn't have any races a year. There are so many opportunities out there and, I love to toe the line. I love to see what I can do and just push the limits and try and experiment with myself.I like that people can look at me, and say, "Wow, if that guy can do 13 marathons a year and do pretty well maybe I can do one." I think a lot of people can relate to that. Like, that guy works a real job. He's not a professional runner.
