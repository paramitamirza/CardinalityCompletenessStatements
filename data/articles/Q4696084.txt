Ahmed al-Gaddafi al-Qahsi (died 26 July 2011) was the cousin of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. In 2006, he married Gaddafi's daughter Ayesha. According to the Gaddafi family, Qahsi, who was a Colonel in the Libyan Army, was killed in the 26 July 2011 bombing of the Gaddafi compound during the Libyan Civil War. The couple had three children before the conflict started. His fourth child, a girl, was born in Algeria as Ayesha fled there with her brothers Hannibal and Muhammad after the Battle of Tripoli.
