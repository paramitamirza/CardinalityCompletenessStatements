Do Won Chang (Hangul: 장도원) born March 20, 1954, is a Korean-born American businessman. He is best known for founding the clothing retail store Forever 21.

Early life

Chang grew up in South Korea and moved to California in 1981 with his wife, Jin Sook Chang.

Career

He and his wife, Jin Sook (Hangul: 진숙), opened a clothing store then named Fashion 21 in 1984 in Highland Park, Los Angeles. This store took off and as they expanded to other locations, the store's name was changed to its current title Forever 21. The number of stores grew to 457 by 2010. The company has since remained a family operation. Forbes in 2012 estimated Chang and his wife's net worth to be $4 billion. This company is one of the most successful female brands in the world. The owners and founders of Forever 21 are Christians, which is why "John 3:16" is on the bottom of every bag.
