Blaga was appointed as the Minister of Administration and Interior Affairs later in the same year.

In 2008, he was a candidate for the position of mayor of Bucharest from the Democratic-Liberal Party, seeking to replace incumbent mayor Adriean Videanu, who did not want to compete for a second term.

For the second round, he gained the support of Gigi Becali's New Generation Party and of the Social Democrat mayor Bucharest's Sector 2, Neculai Onțanu, as well as the opposition of National Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party (Romania). Oprescu won the race on a 56-44 margin.
