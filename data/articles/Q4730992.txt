Allan Studholme (8 December 1846  -  28 July 1919) was a Canadian trade unionist and politician.

Born in England near Birmingham, Studholme worked from his childhood. He moved to Canada in 1878 living in Dundas and Guelph before settling in Hamilton in 1885 where he found work as a stove mounter. An active trade unionist from his days in Britain, Studholme became active in the Knights of Labour and believed that workers should be active in politics on a class basis.

After a short time in Australia and New Zealand he returned to Hamilton in 1901. As a result of his involvement in support of striking streetcar workers he was elected to the Ontario legislature from Hamilton East in a 1906 by-election as an Independent Labour MLA becoming the first Labour member of the Ontario legislature. He remained at Queen's Park until his death in 1919. 

In the legislature, Studholme championed pro-worker legislation such as the eight hour day, a minimum wage and helped bring the Workmen's Compensation Act into existence. He also supported progressive causes such as women's suffrage.
