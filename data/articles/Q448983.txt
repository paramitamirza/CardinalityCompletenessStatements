Published works

She is the author of the 1998 book Me and My Shadows: A Family Memoir. Among its revelations is that she had an affair with Barry Manilow in 1971. In 2001, the book was adapted as an Emmy-winning TV miniseries Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows. It stars Judy Davis as the adult Judy, Tammy Blanchard as the teenage Judy, Hugh Laurie as Vincente Minnelli, Victor Garber as Sid Luft, and Marsha Mason as Ethel Gumm.

Health

On December 17, 2012, Luft discovered a lump on her right breast. "I was in total denial," Luft said. Three weeks later, her radiographer informed her that she had grade-2A breast cancer. Luft called her close friend Barry Manilow, who connected her with cancer specialist David Agus. After reviewing the tests, Agus told her, "I’m looking at your biopsy and I can tell you right now, Lorna, you’re going to be OK." In order to save her breast, Luft opted for a lumpectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation. She completed her final chemotherapy treatment in 2013.

In June 2015, Luft revealed that her cancer had reemerged. Consequently, the UK tour of Judy - The Songbook of Judy Garland concluded early on July 11th, and Luft returned to the United States for surgical treatment.
