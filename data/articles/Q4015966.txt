Svetlana Mironyuk (Russian: Светлана Миронюк) is a Russian media executive, a graduate of Moscow State University. She was head and editor-in-chief of the RIA Novosti news agency, having been appointed chair of the board in 2003 and director general in 2004. She has overseen the organization's modernization. Before that, she was employed with the Media-Most holding owned by Vladimir Gusinsky.

Mironyuk is a contributor to the World Economic Forum.

On 9 December 2013 President of Russia Vladimir Putin issued a decree which abolished RIA Novosti and merged it with the international radio service Voice of Russia to create the new information agency Rossiya Segodnya. On the same day, Mironyuk issued a statement saying that she was not aware of the decision until the decree was published, and that she believed the purpose to be to economize rather than to optimize the information service. This statement caused some protests, and on the next day Mironyuk issued another statement. Without formally retracting the first statement, she said that the duty of all employees of RIA Novosti was to implement the decree of the president, and those who disagreed with the decree were in fact destabilizing the situation, and their activity was purely destructive.
