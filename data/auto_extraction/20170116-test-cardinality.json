            "Playing on a star-laden team which included three former FIFA World Player of the Year recipients, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo and Luís Figo, in addition to Roberto Carlos, Raúl and Iker Casillas, Beckham did not require much time to settle in, scoring five times in his first 16 matches (including a goal less than three minutes into his La Liga debut).",
            "Queiroz mostly favoured the adaptable 5\u20133\u20132 formation with two fullbacks Míchel Salgado and Roberto Carlos often joining the attack down the wings, while Beckham played on the right of the three-man midfield alongside Zidane and Figo.",

            "In the first nine matches Beckham started, Real lost seven.",

            "With Real down 0\u20131 Beckham limped off the field and was replaced by José Antonio Reyes, who scored two goals leading the team to that season's La Liga title, their first since Beckham had signed with them and 30th overall in the club's history.",
            "Though many worldwide media outlets reported the deal to be worth US$250 million, the astronomical figure was soon revealed to be something of a PR stunt engineered by Beckham's media handlers (British representative agency 19 Entertainment).",

            "Another provision was the opt-out clause after the 2009 season, meaning that should he decide so, Beckham was free to leave the club after completing year three of his five-year contract.",

            "Meanwhile, ESPN sports network was running \"Hello, Goodbye\" promotional campaign and it also agreed to air David Beckham: New Beginnings documentary produced by 19 Entertainment and directed by Gary Brooks before the friendly match versus Chelsea, which was expected to be Beckham's American debut.",
            "Since both Beckham's and his wife's often overlapping careers were handled by 19 Entertainment, which is owned by Simon Fuller, who in turn has a business relationship with the Creative Artists Agency (CAA), one of Hollywood's most powerful talent agencies, it was important also for CAA that the Beckhams made as big a splash as possible upon their arrival in the United States.",
            "On Saturday afternoon, 21 July, despite still nursing the injured left ankle that he picked up a month earlier during the final match of La Liga's season, Beckham made his Galaxy debut, coming on for Alan Gordon in the 78th minute of a 0\u20131 friendly loss to Chelsea as part of the World Series of Soccer.",
            "ESPN's presentation of Beckham's debut earned a 1.0 TV rating, meaning it was seen in an average of 947,000 television homes in the US \u2013 a disappointing figure given the national media buzz and two weeks of constant promotion by ESPN.",
            "For comparison ESPN2's weekly MLS broadcasts on Thursdays drew a consistent 0.2 rating on virtually no promotion while Freddy Adu's MLS debut televised on ABC back in 2004 earned a 1.3 rating.",
            "As far as sporting events that were televised that weekend in the United States, Beckham's much publicised debut drew fewer TV viewers than British Open golf tournament, a regular-season national baseball game, and even the Indy Racing League's Honda 200 motor race.",
            "Beckham missed the next four LA Galaxy matches \u2013 three in the North American SuperLiga and an MLS game away at Toronto FC though he still made the trip with his teammates, sitting on the bench in street clothes.",
            "Two weeks after his 12-minute appearance vs. Chelsea, still not fully healed Beckham finally made his league debut as a substitute on 9 August away versus D.C. United in front of the sellout crowd of 46,686 (nearly three times the average D.C. United home crowd) at the RFK Stadium, coming on for Quavas Kirk in the 71st minute.",
            "He hit a long free kick that Carlos Pavón failed to finish on for the equaliser, and then in the final minutes Beckham served a weighted through ball into Landon Donovan's path that United's keeper Troy Perkins managed to break up in the last moment \u2013 the Galaxy lost 1\u20130.",
            "These goals gave the team a 2\u20130 victory, and a place in the North American SuperLiga final versus Pachuca on 29 August.",

            "In the match, Beckham scored an empty-net goal from 70 yards out.",
            "The player chose the number 32 shirt previously worn by Christian Vieri, as both the number 7 and 23 shirts were already used by Alexandre Pato and club captain Massimo Ambrosini, respectively.",
            "After his physical, Beckham was reportedly told by a club doctor that he believed he could continue playing football for another five years, up to the age of 38.",
            "Afterwards, he and wife Victoria watched from a luxury box as Milan won 5\u20131.",

            "Though Beckham was expected to return to Los Angeles in March, after impressing at the Italian club, scoring two goals in his first four matches and assisting on several more, rumours began to swirl that Beckham would stay in Milan, with the Italian club reportedly offering to pay a multimillion-dollar fee for him.",
            "Milan, however, failed to match Galaxy's valuation of Beckham, in the US$10\u201315 million range.",

            "The match was the first time Beckham had played against Manchester United at Old Trafford and saw him create several scoring opportunities via crosses and corner kicks, but Manchester United dominated Milan and beat them 4\u20130, winning the tie 7\u20132.",

            "=== Death (1750) ===",
            "Bach's health declined in 1749; on 2 June, Heinrich von Brühl wrote to one of the Leipzig burgomasters to request that his music director, Johann Gottlob Harrer, fill the Thomaskantor and Director musices posts \"upon the eventual ... decease of Mr. Bach\".",
            "On 28 July 1750, Bach died at the age of 65.",
            "Bach's estate included five harpsichords, two lute-harpsichords, three violins, three violas, two cellos, a viola da gamba, a lute and a spinet, along with 52 \"sacred books\", including books by Martin Luther and Josephus.",
            "For example, the The Well-Tempered Clavier comprises two books, each of which presents a prelude and fugue in every major and minor key, displaying a dizzying variety of structural, contrapuntal and fugal techniques.",
            "In this system a piece of music progresses from one chord to the next according to certain rules, each chord being characterised by four notes.",
            "The major development taking place in Bach's time, and to which he contributed in no small way, was the development of a temperament for keyboard instruments that allowed to use these in all available keys (12 major and 12 minor), and which allowed modulating without retuning.",
            "Already his Capriccio on the departure of a beloved brother, a very early work, showed a gusto for modulation incomparable to any contemporary work this composition has been compared to, but the full expansion came with The Well-Tempered Clavier, using all keys, which Bach seems to have been developing from around 1720, with the Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach as one of its earliest witnesses.",
            "Bach was less imbued; one of the comments after a performance of his St Matthew Passion was that it all sounded much like opera.",
            "Similarly for the cello suites, the virtuoso music seems tailored for the instrument, the best of what is on offer for it, yet Bach made an arrangement for lute of one of these suites.",
            "But it is a very different thing when two melodies are so interwoven that they converse together like two persons upon a footing of pleasant equality.",
            "In the second case the two parts are not similarly related.",
            "From about the year 1720, when he was thirty-five, until his death in 1750, Bach's harmony consists in this melodic interweaving of independent melodies, so perfect in their union that each part seems to constitute the true melody.",
            "Bach composed Passions for Good Friday services and oratorios such as the Christmas Oratorio, which is a set of six cantatas for use in the liturgical season of Christmas.",
            "With its double choir and orchestra the St Matthew Passion is one of Bach's most extended works.",
            "Of these sacred works around 200 are extant, which is estimated as around two thirds of the total number of church cantatas he composed.",
            "The Bach Digital website lists 50 known secular cantatas by the composer, about half of which are extant or largely reconstructable.",
            "Many consist of a large opening chorus followed by one or more recitative-aria pairs for soloists (or duets) and a concluding chorale.",

            "For instance the Visitation cantata Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben, BWV 147, containing the chorale that is known in English as \"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring\", belongs to this first cycle.",
            "His third cantata cycle was developed over a period of several years, followed by the Picander cycle of 1728\u201329.",
            "Later church cantatas include the chorale cantatas Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott, BWV 80 (final version) and Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, BWV 140.",

            "Bach church music in Latin includes his Magnificat, four Kyrie\u2013Gloria Masses, and his Mass in B minor.",
            "Near the end of his life, around 1748\u201349 he expanded this composition into the large scale Mass in B minor.",
            "Bach wrote for the organ and other keyboard instruments of his day, mainly the harpsichord, but also the clavichord and his personal favourite: the lute-harpsichord (the compositions listed as works for the lute, BWV 995-1000 and 1006a were probably written for this instrument).",
            "During his most productive period (1708\u201314) he composed about a dozen pairs of preludes and fugues, five toccatas and fugues, and the Little Organ Book, an unfinished collection of forty-six short chorale preludes that demonstrates compositional techniques in the setting of chorale tunes.",
            "After leaving Weimar, Bach wrote less for organ, although some of his best-known works (the six trio sonatas, the German Organ Mass in Clavier-Übung III from 1739, and the Great Eighteen chorales, revised late in his life) were composed after his leaving Weimar.",
            "The larger works are usually intended for a harpsichord with two manuals, while performing them on a keyboard instrument with a single manual (like a piano) may provide technical difficulties for the crossing of hands.",

            "Many of his solo works, such as his six sonatas and partitas for violin (BWV 1001\u20131006) and his six cello suites (BWV 1007\u20131012), are widely considered among the most profound in the repertoire.",
            "He wrote sonatas for a solo instrument such as the viola de gamba accompanied by harpsichord or continuo, as well as trio sonatas (two instruments and continuo).",
            "Surviving works in the concerto form include two violin concertos (BWV 1041 in A minor and BWV 1042 in E major) and a concerto for two violins in D minor, BWV 1043, often referred to as Bach's \"double\" concerto.",

            "This was however far from the end of attribution issues, for instance Schlage doch, gewünschte Stunde, BWV 53 was later re-attributed to Melchior Hoffmann.",
            "For other works, Bach's authorship was put in doubt without a generally accepted answer to the question whether or not he composed it: the best known organ composition in the BWV catalogue, the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565 was indicated as one of these uncertain works in the late 20th century.",
            "Soon after the 1829 performance Bach started to become regarded as one of the greatest composers of all times, if not the greatest, a reputation he kept ever since.",
            "Among these were the Swingle Singers' versions of Bach pieces (for instance, the \"Air\" from Orchestral Suite No. 3, or the Wachet Auf... chorale prelude) and Wendy Carlos' 1968 Switched-On Bach, which used the Moog electronic synthesiser.",
            "One such connoisseur was Gottfried van Swieten, a high-ranked Austrian official who was instrumental in passing Bach's legacy to the composers of the Viennese school.",

            "In 1805 Abraham Mendelssohn, who had married one of Itzig's granddaughters, bought a substantial collection of Bach manuscripts that had come down from C. P. E. Bach, and donated these to the Berlin Sing-Akademie.",
            "Also vocal music: Motets in 1802 and 1803, followed by the E♭ major version of the Magnificat, the Kyrie-Gloria Mass in A major, and the cantata Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott (BWV 80).",
            "When Felix Mendelssohn, Abraham's son, aged 13, produced his first Magnificat setting in 1822 it was clear that he was inspired by the then unpublished D major version of Bach's Magnificat.",
            "Besides these and other public performances and an increased coverage on the composer and his compositions in printed media, the 1830s and 40s also saw the first publication of more vocal works by Bach: six cantatas, the St Matthew Passion and the Mass in B minor.",
            "Chopin started composing his 24 Preludes, Op. 28, inspired by the Well-Tempered Clavier, in 1835, and Schumann published his Sechs Fugen über den Namen B-A-C-H in 1845.",

            "Throughout the 19th century 200 books were published on Bach.",
            "By the end of the century, Bach was firmly established as one of the greatest composers, recognised for both his instrumental and his vocal music.",
            "But that was far from the only way Bach's music came to the forefront in the 20th century: his music was heard in versions ranging from Ferruccio Busoni's late romantic piano transcriptions, jazzy interpretations such as those by the Swingle Singers, and orchestrations such as the one opening Walt Disney's Fantasia movie, to synthesiser performances such as Wendy Carlos' Switched-On Bach recordings.",
            "Several 20th century composers referred to Bach or his music, for instance Eugène Ysaÿe in his Six Sonatas for solo violin, Dmitri Shostakovich in his 24 Preludes and Fugues and Heitor Villa-Lobos in his Bachianas Brasileiras.",
