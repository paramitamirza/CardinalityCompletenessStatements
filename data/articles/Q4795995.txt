Arrington Dixon is an American politician who is a former city council member and chairman of Washington, D.C. In 2008, he was D.C.'s male representative on the Democratic National Committee and a thus a superdelegate to the Democratic National Convention. He ran for reelection as national committeeman in the September 2008 Democratic primary but was defeated by Vincent Orange, 56 to 44 percent.

He was also appointed by Mayor Barry to serve as a public member of the National Capital Planning Commission. In 1996 he married Sharon Pratt Kelly, and they had daughters Aimee and Drew. Sharon Pratt later became D.C. mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly from 1991-1995. The couple divorced in 1982 after sixteen years of marriage. His daughters were born in 1968 and 1970. They divorced after sixteen years.

Council of the District of Columbia

In November 1974, Dixon was chosen to represent Ward 4 when voters elected the first members of the Council of the District of Columbia, the legislature of the city's new home rule government. The initial term for the Ward 4 seat, like those for half the council seats, was only 2 years, to provide for staggered council elections in later years, but in 1976 Dixon was reelected to a full 4-year term.

In 1978, council chairman Sterling Tucker ran for mayor rather than seeking reelection. Dixon, who was halfway through his Ward 4 term, decided to run for council chairman and won. He served 4 years. In 1982 he ran for reelection but was defeated in the Democratic primary by David A. Clarke.

More than a decade later, Dixon returned to the council as an at-large member for a few months in 1997 when he was chosen in August by the District of Columbia Democratic State Committee to replace Linda Cropp, who had vacated her at-large seat to become chairman. The appointment lasted only until a December special election, in which he was defeated by then-Republican David Catania. Catania was sworn in on December 15, 1997.
