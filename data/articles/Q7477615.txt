Biography

Petry grew up in Brandenburg. In 1992 her family moved to Bergkamen in Westphalia. Petry took her first degree in chemistry at the University of Reading in 1998, before attending the University of Göttingen, gaining a doctoral degree there in 2004.

In 2007 Petry founded her own business, PURinvent, a Leipzig based manufacturer of polyurethane tire fill products. She received the Medal of the Order of Merit in 2012.

In her party she represents the national conservative faction and supports right-wing policies.

Petry was married to a pastor named Sven, has four children, and lives in Tautenhain, Saxony. Petry published a statement in early October in which she announced that she would separate from her husband, while also noting that “much more than just friendly feelings” had developed between her and fellow party member Marcus Pretzell. Sven Petry has since joined the CDU.
