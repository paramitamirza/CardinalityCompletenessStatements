Sheana Keane (born 27 May 1975) is an Irish presenter on Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ). She presented the programmes Health Squad (2001 - 2006) and The Afternoon Show (2004 - 2005; 2006 - 2010).

Her broadcasting career began as a researcher on Wanderlust (RTÉ's Internet-based blind date programme) in 2001 and as a researcher and broadcaster on the daytime talk show Open House in 2002.

One of RTÉ's new generation of "rising stars", Keane's interviewing skills stem from her commercial background as a Change Management Consultant.

Personal Life

She was educated at University College Dublin and holds a master's degree in psychology. She is married to Jonathan Forrest, managing director of Cybercom, and they have two children. 

2014-Present TV3

In 2014, after almost four years since presenting The Afternoon Show on RTÉ One, Keane reportedly is set to begin presenting Late Lunch Live on TV3 in a bid to improve ratings by bosses. It is unclear whether this will be temporary or permanent.
