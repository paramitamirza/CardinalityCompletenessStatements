Born in Sydney, Watt completed a Graduate Diploma of Film and Television (Animation) at the Swinburne Film and Television School (now VCA), Melbourne in 1990.

She received the Australian Film Institute's award for Best Director for her 2005 film Look Both Ways.

Watt returned to the VCA School of Film and Television to teach animation and was to assist in the development of many animators including Academy Award winner Adam Eliot in 1996.

During the post-production of Look Both Ways, Watt was diagnosed with cancer. Her second film My Year Without Sex was released in 2009.
