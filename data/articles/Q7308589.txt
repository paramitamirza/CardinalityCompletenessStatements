Reginald Ballard (born October 13, 1965) is an American character actor and comedian from Galveston, Texas, who is probably best known as "Bruh-man from the fifth flo'" (he would often hold up four fingers when saying this) in the Fox sitcom Martin. After graduation from Ball High School, where he was an all district linebacker, Ballard earned a full football scholarship to Southern Methodist University, where he was also a theatre major. Just before his senior year, Ballard transferred to the University of Missouri, where he continued to play football, while continuing to act, appearing in a university production of A Soldier's Story in the role of C.J. Memphis.

Spurning overtures from pro-football, Ballard headed to Hollywood to pursue his acting career. His film debut was in 1989's Lock Up. He has appeared in many different television shows, such as Veronica Mars (the episode "Return of the Kane"), The Bernie Mac Show, The Parkers, Sister, Sister, Just Jordan, and the short-lived show, Crumbs. He co-starred in the independent film Big Ain't Bad as Butch. Currently, Ballard is performing stand up comedy. He is also a former all-district linebacker for Ball High School. He was a speedy linebacker for the Tors, helping Ball High to a 7-3 record his senior season in 1983. He also helped lead the best defense in District 24-5A that year, a defense that allowed only 60.9 yards per game. After playing football at SMU Mustangs for his first three college years, Ballard transferred to Missouri for his senior year after the SMU football program was hit for NCAA violations. He said the acting bug bit him after taking a theater class in college, "getting lost in a scene", and listening to the audience applaud.

Personal life

Ballard is married with two children, and the family resides in Pasadena, California.
