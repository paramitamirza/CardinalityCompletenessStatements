Manuel Mercado "Lito" Lapid (born 25 October 1955 in Porac, Pampanga) is a Filipino actor, politician and Senator of the Republic of the Philippines.

Education

Lapid was born in Porac, Pampanga on October 25, 1955. Lapid was the fifth child of Jose Lapid and Eleuteria Mercado. He completed his elementary education at the Porac Central School in 1968 and secondary education at St. Catherine Academy in Porac in 1972. He did not enroll for his tertiary education. 

Film

Lapid entered the film industry as a stuntman, and became an actor. 

Political career

In the 1992 general election he ran under the opposition block Nationalist People's Coalition as vice governor of Pampanga, and defeated the incumbent vice governor Cielo Macapagal-Salgado.

In 1995, he ran against Governor Bren Guiao as governor of Pampanga under the same party and won. When he sought a second term in 1998, Lapid joined the administration party Lakas-NUCD. After the impeachment of President Joseph Estrada in 2000 and the second EDSA Revolution the following year, he ran again for his final term and won.

He decided to run as mayor of Angeles City, Pampanga in the 2004 elections but abandoned his plans when he was encouraged to run as senator.

Senator of the Philippines

But in the 2004 Senatorial elections, his fellow cabalen, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo encouraged him to run as senator under the administration coalition K4. He accepted the offer and won the election landing in the eleventh position. In the bid to change the Philippine Constitution, Lapid was rumored to be planning to participate in the House backed Constituent Assembly  but Lapid backed the senate resolution against the resolution passed by the House of Representatives creating the constituent assembly without Senate concurrence.

In May 2006, Lapid said he would run against Jejomar Binay as mayor of Makati City citing reasons that he could save Makati from public demonstrations against President Arroyo. He further stated that he could retain his position as senator in case he lost in the 2007 local elections. Senators Panfilo Lacson, Raul Roco, Miriam Defensor Santiago, Sergio Osme√±a III, Juan Ponce Enrile, Francisco Tatad all retained their senate seats when they ran for higher elective positions President and Vice President in the 1998 and 2004 elections. However, eminent former justice Isagani Cruz takes exception to this view.

In May 2010, Lapid was re-elected as Senator placing 11th in the overall ranking. Lapid ran under the Lakas-CMD but subsequently left the party in 2012. He is currently an Independent.

Lapid is the principal author of the "Lapid Law", which provides expanded Free Legal Services to indigent Filipinos. Lapid is currently the Senate Committee on Tourism and Cooperatives Chairman.

Personal life

Lapid married Marissa Tadeo,  with whom he has two sons and two daughters.
