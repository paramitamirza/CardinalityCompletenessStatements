Timothy Brian Storey (born November 2, 1960 in Lynwood, California) is an American life coach, self-help author, motivational speaker, and entrepreneur. He is founder of Tim Storey Kids Foundation.

Family

Storey grew up in a family of mixed heritage. He is the son of Anthony and Bessie Storey and the youngest of five children. His father died when he was 10 years old, followed by his sister's death by car accident when he was 13 years old. He has two children, Isaiah and Chloe.

Education

Storey studied at Southeastern University for three years and holds a Bachelor of Arts Degree from Southern California College, now called Vanguard University. He has also received his doctorate of divinity from Bethany Theological Seminary.

Career

Before Storey was known as a life coach, he began teaching and praying for large masses of people as a traveling minister at 20 years old. His first speaking engagement was in front of 15,000 people, overseas. Now, he is a speaker, author and Life Coach who has traveled to 70 countries.

Back in 1992, a group of individuals believing in the power of possibilities, gathered together with Tim and eventually started the Hollywood Bible Study at the home of Dyan Cannon with seven people. Over the years, thousands of industry professionals and friends showed up monthly to be reminded and encouraged that things were not always what they seemed at first.

Through this study, Tim has helped countless world shakers, like Robert Downey Jr., Kanye West, Christian Slater, Deion Sanders, Natalie Cole, Charlie Sheen, Hunter Tylo, Berry Gordy, Suzanne De Passe, Quincy Jones, Lee Iacocca, Brent Bolthouse and so many more.

Over the years, it has gone from large crowded sessions at the Mondrian Hotel, Wyndham Bel Age (The London) and the Hyatt Andaz West Hollywood to small intimate gatherings in homes across the world in Beverly Hills, Miami, New York, Stockholm and Johannesburg.

The Study is currently meeting at the famous East West Studios in Hollywood, home of legends like Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Elvis Presley, the Beach Boys, Ray Charles, Johnny Cash and Michael Jackson, NBC’s The Voice, GLEE, Weezer, Stevie Wonder, U2, Sir Elton John and Incubus. Recently renovated by renowned designer Philippe Starck, EastWest is the perfect spot to get intimate and dive in and take us beyond our immediate perception of life.
