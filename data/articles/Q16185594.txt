On October 29, 2013, during an interview with the Las Vegas Sun, Sisolak made known that he favors an assault weapon ban, saying "...You don’t use an assault weapon to go duck hunting or deer hunting, so I don’t think there’s a need. It’s not really an issue of protection. I just don’t think there’s a need for people to own assault weapons." So a ban like that is something you’d be in favor of? "I would."
