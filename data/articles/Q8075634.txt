Early life and education

Zwe Ohn Chein, born Ohn Chein, the ninth of ten siblings, was born in Mandalay, Burma to wealthy rice merchants. His parents lost their fortune during a storm. U Zwe Ohn Chein then supported his parents by selling flowers. After his parents passing, he went to Rangoon (Yangon) on a bicycle and became a clerical assistant at age 20. As he was literate in English, he taught himself Pitman shorthand which he then used to invent his own Burmese shorthand technique in his later years.

By around 1956, he had successfully established Zwe Ohn Chein Shorthand College in Burma, published books on Burmese shorthand and typewriting, and was the headmaster and the controller of Zwe Ohn Chein Shorthand College. Around 1958, he won a contract with Remington typewriters for his typewriting books to accompany the sale of each Remington Burmese typewriter in Burma.
