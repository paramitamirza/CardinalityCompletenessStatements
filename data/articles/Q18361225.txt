In 2007, having grown disenchanted with show business and desiring that his son experience where he grew up, Luke decided to take a break from acting and moved his family from Los Angeles to his hometown of Danville, where he opened a restaurant with his brother. After two years, he decided to return to acting and he and his family returned to New York. His agent suggested he audition for the role of one of three protagonists of Rockstar Games' newest entry in the popular Grand Theft Auto series. Luke initially balked at the idea of being in a video game, but after reading the script decided to proceed with the audition. Luke was eventually cast as one of the game's three protagonists, Michael de Santa. The game went on to set several sales records and has become the highest grossing video game in history.
