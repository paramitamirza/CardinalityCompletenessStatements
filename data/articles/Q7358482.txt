Roger Maurice Knapman (born 20 February 1944 in Crediton, Devon) is a British politician and a former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP).

Early life

He was educated at the Royal Agricultural College. Before entering politics, he was a Chartered Surveyor.

Parliamentary career

As a member of the Conservative Party, he was elected MP for Stroud in 1987. Between 1990 and 1992, he served asParliamentary Private Secretary to the armed forces minister, Archie Hamilton. He resigned from this position in order to oppose the Maastricht Treaty. He successfully defended his seat in the 1992 general election. In 1995 he became a government whip. In 1997, however, he lost his seat to the Labour candidate, David Drew.

UKIP

Shortly afterwards, Knapman left the Conservative party to join UKIP. He stood as their candidate in the 2001 general election for North Devon, coming fourth yet narrowly retaining his deposit.

From 2000, he was UKIP's political advisor, and in 2002 he was elected unopposed as party leader. In 2004 he was elected a Member of the European Parliament for the South West England constituency. As leader of the only British party in the European Parliament to vote against the expansion of the EU in 2004 (and publicly opposing immigration), there was some amusement in May 2006 when it was revealed that he had employed a team of Polish builders to renovate his Grade II listed home in Devon, claiming there were no suitable local workers - a claim denied by local builders.

He contested Totnes at the 2005 general election, coming 4th with 7.7% of the vote.

He announced in 2006 that he had no intention of seeking re-election as party leader; the leadership contest was won in September of that year by Nigel Farage MEP. Knapman was the only leader of UKIP to have succeeded in completing a full four-year term until Farage successfully did so in 2014 after returning to the role in 2010.
