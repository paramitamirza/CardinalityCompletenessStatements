He later became adjutant-general in Ireland and spent some 20 years as a Member of Parliament before retiring to Inveraray Castle.

Military career

Born the son of John Campbell, 4th Duke of Argyll and Mary Campbell (n√©e Bellenden, the daughter of John Bellenden, 2nd Lord Bellenden of Broughton), Campbell was educated at a private school in London and commissioned as second lieutenant in the 21st Royal Scots Fusiliers in 1739.

He became Member of Parliament for Glasgow Burghs in March 1744 but was immediately deployed to Flanders to serve in the War of the Austrian Succession.

Campbell became lieutenant colonel commanding the 30th Regiment of Foot early in 1745 and was redeployed to Scotland where he opposed the Jacobites at Loch Fyne in November 1745 at an early stage of the Jacobite Rebellion. He went on to see action under Lieutenant General Henry Hawley at the Battle of Falkirk Muir where the British cavalry was completely routed in January 1746. He also served under the Duke of Cumberland at the Battle of Culloden where the Jacobites were finally defeated in April 1746.

He was promoted to major-general on 25 August 1759 and to lieutenant general on 19 January 1761. He took the courtesy title of Marquess of Lorne, and stood down from the House of Commons on his disqualification from representing a Scottish seat, when his father became 4th Duke of Argyll on 15 April 1761. He became Deputy Commander-in-Chief, Scotland in 1762 and was elected unopposed as Member of Parliament for Dover, an English seat, in January 1765.

Campbell stood down from the House of Commons again when, on the formation of the Chatham Ministry, he was created Baron Sundridge in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in November 1766. He was appointed Commander-in-Chief, Scotland in 1767, succeeded his father as 5th Duke of Argyll in November 1770 and was promoted to full general on 24 March 1778. He went on to be colonel of the 3rd Regiment of Footguards in May 1782 and, having been appointed Lord Lieutenant of Argyllshire on 6 May 1794, was promoted to field marshal on 30 July 1796.
