Tan Sri Datuk Mohamad Asri Muda (10 October 1923 - 28 August 1992) was a Malaysian politician who served as the President of the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) from 1969 to 1982, and as the Menteri Besar (Chief Minister) of Kelantan.

Early and personal life

Asri was born on 11 October 1923 in Kota Bharu, the capital of Kelantan. He was a school teacher and journalist before entering politics. He was elected to the Kelantan State Assembly and the federal House of Representatives in the 1959 election. He married to Sakinah Junid on August 15, 1948 and has 9 children, 2 males and 7 females, namely Noor Dianauli, Husni Zaim, Ratna Inzah, Pearl Sabihah, Aliyah, Khalidah, Nasibah, Najah and Mohd Taqiuddin 

Menteri Besar of Kelantan

Asri became the Menteri Besar of Kelantan in 1964, replacing Ishak Lotfi Omar. He served as Menteri Besar until 1974, when he resigned to become a Minister in the federal government.

PAS Presidency

Under Asri's leadership, PAS became a member of the governing Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition for the first and only time, from 1973 to 1978. Asri became the Minister for Land and Rural Development in the BN government. Asri's leadership was also notable for the shifting of PAS's outlook towards Malay nationalism. Both joining the BN coalition and moving away from religious-based policy platforms caused the party to lose support. In 1982, Asri was ousted as PAS leader by the religious ulama faction of the party, to be replaced by Yusof Rawa. After Asri's tenure, PAS shifted to a more radical religious platform.

After PAS

Following his loss of the PAS presidency, Asri founded the Muslim People's Party of Malaysia or Parti Hizbul Muslimin Malaysia (Hamim) but failed to achieve any electoral success. In 1988, he joined PAS's rivals, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), claiming that PAS had "deviated" and had been "infiltrated by extremist foreign elements".
