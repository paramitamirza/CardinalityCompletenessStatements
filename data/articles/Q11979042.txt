John Roecker is an independent filmmaker who is associated with the punk subculture. He currently resides in Los Angeles, California. Roecker is probably best known for Live Freaky! Die Freaky!, a stop motion animated comedy based on the true crime book Helter Skelter.

From 1996 to 1999, Roecker and Exene Cervenka co-owned Los Angeles store "You've Got Bad Taste."
