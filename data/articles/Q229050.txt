Early life

She has a younger brother, Randy, a former actor who  works as a life coach. Spelling's parents were both Jewish, and their ancestors immigrated from Russia and Poland. The family celebrated both Christmas and Hanukkah while she was growing up. Her middle name comes from her paternal grandfather, David. She attended Beverly Hills High School in Beverly Hills, California, but graduated from Harvard-Westlake School in 1991.

Career

Early work

At age six, Spelling was given acting lessons from an acting coach hired by her father Aaron and subsequently was given guest spots on shows such as The Love Boat, T. J. Hooker, Hotel, Fantasy Island, Vega$, and Saved by the Bell. At the age of 17, she was given the role of Donna Martin on Beverly Hills, 90210, a series co-produced by her father Aaron's company Spelling Television. Spelling portrayed Donna for the show's entire run and was nominated for two Young Artist Awards. Donna remained a virgin for about seven years, that is until the finale of the seventh season, supposedly due to Aaron Spelling's edict.

While starring on 90210, Spelling was cast in a number of made-for-television films, including Co-Ed Call Girl (1992), A Friend to Die For (1994), and Mother, May I Sleep with Danger? (1996). Subsequently, Spelling appeared in several independent films including The House of Yes (1997) and Trick (1999).

2006-2009

In 2006, Spelling starred as herself in the VH1 sitcom So Notorious, which parodied her public image. In January 2007, she and her second husband Dean McDermott pretended to purchase and operate a bed and breakfast hotel in Fallbrook, California for their reality show, Tori & Dean: Inn Love, which premiered on the Oxygen network on March 20, 2007. In July 2007, Spelling became a minister to marry a gay couple at Chateau La Rue. A tape of the ceremony was shown on Inn Love. In June 2008, the show returned for a third season under a new title, Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood. In the new season, Spelling and McDermott discontinued the inn plotline, and they returned to Los Angeles where they portrayed a struggle to balance buying a new home, their second child Stella, and Spelling's book tour. In May 2009, Home Sweet Hollywood was aired for a fourth season.

On January 7, 2009, it was reported that Spelling would reprise her role as Donna Martin on the new CW show 90210. She appeared in two episodes (19 and 20) as a special guest star.

2010-present

In 2010, Spelling released her third book, uncharted terriTORI. Spelling told People: "I love sharing my stories and experiences with people and connecting to them on both a humorous and emotional level. The response to my first two books has been so amazing that I wanted to write a third one for my fans."

Spelling's spin-off series Tori & Dean: sTORIbook Weddings premiered on April 6, 2011. Writers lodged a suit against Spelling, claiming that they had presented the ideas for a "wedding show" to her company, but were told there was no interest in producing the show.  Later that year, Spelling voiced the Pirate Princess in Jake and the Never Land Pirates. She played a role in the comedy short movie "Hoarders: Untold sTori" which premiered at the Outfest Film Festival in July 2011.

On September 4, 2011, Spelling made an appearance on Big Brother 13.

On April 21, 2012, Spelling hosted My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic 'Royal Wedding' special, celebrating the show's second season finale, called A Canterlot Wedding. She also hosted the series premiere of Craft Wars, where three new contestants each episode battle against each other crafting for a chance to earn $10,000.

On December 18, 2012, Spelling appeared on Nick Jr's Yo Gabba Gabba and performed a skit where she baked cookies for the characters on the show. This was part of a Christmas special for the show. The special, included other famous guests such as Tony Hawk and My Chemical Romance.

It was announced on August 26, 2013, that production has started on a new reality television series titled Tori & Dean: Cabin Fever. The series chronicles Spelling, her husband, and their four children as they move to a lakeside cabin in Ontario, Canada while renovating it into their vacation home. Eight, half-hour episodes will be produced and air on CMT Canada and HGTV in 2014.

Spelling starred in the short-lived ABC Family TV series Mystery Girls with former 90210 co-star Jennie Garth in 2014.

Personal life

On July 3, 2004, Spelling married actor and playwright Charlie Shanian in a lavish $1 million ceremony. They separated in October 2005. Shanian cited irreconcilable differences when he filed for divorce, which was finalized on April 20, 2006.

Spelling married Dean McDermott less than a month later, on May 7, 2006, in a private ceremony in Wakaya, Fiji. McDermott was married to Mary Jo Eustace (1993-2006), but they separated and divorced after his affair with Spelling. Spelling and McDermott renewed their vows on May 8, 2010 in Beverly Hills, California. McDermott brings to the marriage son Jack (October 1998).

The couple has four children: sons Liam Aaron (born March 13, 2007) and Finn Davey (born August 30, 2012), and daughters Stella Doreen (born June 9, 2008) and Hattie Margaret (born October 10, 2011).

Spelling's father Aaron died on June 23, 2006. She was anticipated to inherit a sizable portion of her father's $500 million estate. The estate was to be divided primarily between Spelling, her brother Randy, and her mother Candy. Candy was the estate executor, but she and Tori were estranged. Tori and her brother each inherited $800,000, although Randy was not estranged. It was reported that Candy established a $10 million trust fund for Tori Spelling's eldest child, Liam.

In her sixth book, "Spelling It Like It Is," Tori admitted to having financial troubles, due to their reality show getting cancelled, poor real estate decisions, and a very difficult fourth pregnancy. In explanation, Spelling said, "...as my real estate obsession persists, it's starting to look more compulsive. Moving is expensive, and I've put us in a precarious financial situation."  After her fourth pregnancy, Spelling shared that husband Dean McDermott wanted to get a vasectomy but they couldn't afford it. Spelling claims that she hasn't bought a new purse in three years, but seems to have a caviar taste with her current tuna fish budget. "Even when I try to embrace a simpler lifestyle, I can't seem to let go of my expensive tastes," she said in an interview.

Spelling now claims to be repurposing, using hand-me-down clothes for her children, and toning down her children's once lavish birthday parties. “I can’t afford to live like this anymore. Our circumstances have changed,” she explained.

In December 2013, news broke that Spelling's husband, Dean McDermott, had cheated on his wife with 28-year-old Emily Goodhand. After telling Goodhand that he had a sexless marriage, the two had a two-day affair. Spelling decided to document the make-or-break relationship on a 6-episode Lifetime documentary, True Tori. Some suspect the couple of making up the entire story for a paycheck, due to several timing inconsistencies, along with the nearly impossible-to-locate mistress.

Spelling is an ordained minister with the Universal Life Church Monastery.
