Michael Troughton (born 2 March 1955) is an English actor, writer, and teacher. He is the son of actor Patrick Troughton (known as the Second Doctor in Doctor Who in the 1960s) and the younger brother of David Troughton.

Career

He has appeared in many film, television and theatre roles, most notably as Melish in Minder and Sir Piers Fletcher-Dervish in The New Statesman from 1987 to 1992. Troughton also starred in the first series of Backs to the Land. His more recent roles include senior science master Derek Halliday in the Taggart episode "Out of Bounds", 1998, a therapist in the fourth series of Cold Feet and Mr Mermagen in Enigma.

Troughton took a break from acting in 2002 in order to care for his disabled wife and obtained a science degree, from the Open University. He then taught Physics at Sir John Leman school in Beccles for two years, before moving to Woodbridge School to become Head of Drama.

In 2009 he stopped teaching and became a full-time carer. His biography of his late father Patrick Troughton, published by Hirst Publishing, was launched at the 2011 Dimensions Convention in Newcastle in November 2011. In 2013 he returned to acting, appearing in the ITV series Breathless. He has also completed a number of audio dramatisations for Big Finish.

Troughton appeared in the 2014 Doctor Who Christmas Special Last Christmas as Professor Albert.
