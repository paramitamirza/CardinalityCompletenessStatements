Personal life

Belz was raised in the grain and lumber business, but learned the importance of the print media when his parents opened up a printing business out of their home. In 1946 his father entered the Presbyterian ministry and in 1951 his parents opened Cono Christian School.  He earned a BA in English from Covenant College in Lookout Mountain, GA in 1962 and an MA in communications from the University of Iowa in 1971. He is a member and elder in the Presbyterian Church in America. Belz and his wife, Carol Esther, have six children and eight grandchildren. They live in North Carolina. 

In November 2009, Belz signed an ecumenical statement known as the Manhattan Declaration calling on evangelicals, Catholics and Orthodox not to comply with rules and laws permitting abortion, same-sex marriage and other matters that go against their religious consciences.
