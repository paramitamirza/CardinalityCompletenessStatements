#Type: regular article

Wardell Stephen "Steph" Curry II (born March 14, 1988) is an American professional basketball player who currently plays for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He is considered by some to be the greatest shooter in NBA history. He was named the 2015 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) and is a two-time NBA All-Star. He is the son of former NBA player Dell Curry, and the older brother of current NBA player Seth Curry.

Curry played college basketball for Davidson. There, he was twice named Southern Conference Player of the Year and set the all-time scoring record for both Davidson and the Southern Conference. During his sophomore year, Curry also set the single-season NCAA record for three-pointers made.

Curry was selected with the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors. During the 2012-13 season, he set the NBA record for three-pointers made in a regular season with 272. The following year, Curry and teammate Klay Thompson set the NBA record for combined threes in a season with 484, earning the pair the nickname the "Splash Brothers". In 2014-15, Curry eclipsed his own record by knocking down his 273rd three-pointer on April 9, 2015, finishing the regular season with 286. He was named MVP after leading the Warriors to a franchise-record and NBA-best 67 wins on the season. That same year, Curry led the Warriors to their first NBA championship since 1975.

Early life

Curry was born in Akron, Ohio but grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina where his father Dell played for the Charlotte Hornets. Curry's father often took him and his younger brother Seth to his games, where they would sometimes shoot around with his team during warm-ups. As a child, he attended a Montessori school that had been started by his mother, Sonya.

From 2001 to 2002, during his father's tenure with the Toronto Raptors, Curry lived in Toronto and attended Queensway Christian College in Etobicoke, Ontario. There, he was a member of the grades 7 and 8 boys basketball team, leading them to an undefeated season.

Curry went to high school at Charlotte Christian where he was named all-state, all-conference, and led his team to three conference titles and three state playoff appearances. The then 6 ft, 160-pound senior did not receive any scholarship offers from major-conference schools. Since his father played for Virginia Tech and is in their Hall of Fame, Curry wanted to play for the Hokies, but they only offered him a place as a walk-on player. After receiving scholarship offers from Davidson, VCU, and Winthrop, he chose Davidson, a school that had not won an NCAA Tournament game since 1969.

College career

Freshman season

Before Curry even played one college game, head coach Bob McKillop said at a Davidson alumni event, "Wait 'til you see Steph Curry. He is something special." In his first collegiate game, against Eastern Michigan, Curry finished with 15 points but committed 13 turnovers. In the next game, against Michigan, he scored 32 points, dished out 4 assists, and grabbed 9 rebounds. Curry finished the season leading the Southern Conference in scoring with 21.5 points per game. He was second in the nation among freshmen in scoring, behind only Kevin Durant of Texas. Curry's scoring ability helped the Wildcats to a 29-5 overall record and a Southern Conference regular season title. On March 2, 2007, in the Southern Conference tournament semi-finals against Furman, Curry made his 113th three-pointer of the year, breaking Keydren Clark's NCAA freshman season record for 3-point field goals.

Curry eclipsed the school freshman scoring record with his 502nd point against Chattanooga on February 6, 2007. On March 15, 2007, Davidson marched into the NCAA tournament as a 13 seed set to play Maryland; despite Curry's game-high 30 points, Davidson lost 82-70. At the end of his freshman season, Curry was named Southern Conference Freshman of the Year, SoCon Tournament MVP, and selected to the SoCon All-tournament team, All-freshman team, and first team All-SoCon. He was also honorable mention in Sports Illustrated's All-Mid-Major. After the season ended, he was selected for the USA team to appear at the 2007 FIBA U19 World Championships in which he averaged 9.4 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 2.2 assists in 19.4 minutes, helping team USA to a silver medal finish.

Sophomore season

In his sophomore season in 2007-08, Curry had grown to his adult height of 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m) and again led the Southern Conference in scoring, averaging 25.5 points per game while adding 4.7 rebounds per game and 2.8 assists per game. He led the Wildcats to a 26-6 regular season record, and a 20-0 conference record. As a result, Davidson earned its third straight NCAA Tournament bid.

On March 21, 2008, Davidson matched up with seventh seeded Gonzaga. Gonzaga led by eleven points early in the second half but Curry went on to score 30 points in the half to push Davidson to their first NCAA Tournament win since 1969, 82-76. Curry ended the game with 40 points while also going 8-for-10 from 3-point range. On March 23, Davidson played second seeded Georgetown in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. Georgetown, ranked eighth nationally, entered the game as a heavy favorite after an appearance in the Final Four in 2007. Curry managed just five points in the first half of the game as Davidson trailed by as many as 17 points, but his 25 second-half points led Davidson to a 74-70 comeback victory.

On March 28, 2008, Curry led Davidson to another win against third-seeded Wisconsin. Curry scored 33 points as Davidson won 73-56 to advance to the Elite 8. Curry joined Clyde Lovellette, Jerry Chambers, and Glenn Robinson as the only college players to score over 30 points in their first four career NCAA tournament games. Curry also tied Darrin Fitzgerald of Butler for the single-season record for most three-pointers with 158. On March 30, 2008, he set the record, against the top-seeded Kansas Jayhawks, with his 159th three-pointer of the season. Curry scored 25 points in the game but Davidson lost 57-59, and the Jayhawks went on to win the championship.

Curry finished the season averaging 25.9 points, 2.9 assists, and 2.1 steals per game. He was named to the Associated Press' All-America Second Team on March 31, 2008.  He also was named the Most Outstanding Player of the Midwest Region of the 2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Tournament, becoming the first player from a team not making the Final Four to do so since Juwan Howard of Michigan in 1994. Curry was nominated for an ESPY in the Breakthrough Player of the Year category.

Junior season

After Davidson's loss in the NCAA Regional Finals against Kansas, Curry announced that he would return for his junior year. Curry stated he wanted to develop as a point guard as that would be his most likely position in the NBA. On November 18, 2008, Curry scored a career-high 44 points in Davidson's 82-78 loss to Oklahoma. He extended a career-long streak by scoring at least 25 points for the seventh straight game. On November 21, Curry registered a career-high 13 assists, to go along with 30 points, in Davidson's 97-70 win over Winthrop. On November 25, against Loyola, he was held scoreless as Loyola constantly double-teamed Curry. It was Curry's only scoreless collegiate game and just his second without double-digit points. He finished 0-for-3 from the field as Davidson won the game 78-48. In Davidson's next game (11 days later), Curry matched his career-high of 44 in a 72-67 win over North Carolina State.

Curry surpassed the 2000-point mark for his career on January 3, 2009, as he scored 21 points against Samford. February 14, 2009, Curry rolled his ankle in the second half of a win over Furman. The injury caused Curry to miss the February 18 game against The Citadel, the first and only game he missed in his college career. On February 28, 2009, Curry became Davidson's all-time leading scorer with 34 points in a 99-56 win against Georgia Southern. That gave Curry 2,488 points for his career, surpassing previous school leader John Gerdy. Davidson won the 2008-09 Southern Conference regular season championship for the south division, finishing 18-2 in the conference.

In the 2009 Southern Conference Tournament, Davidson played Appalachian State in the quarterfinals and won 84-68. Curry scored 43 points, which is the third most points in Southern Conference tournament history. In the semifinals, against the College of Charleston, Curry had 20 points but Davidson lost 52-59. Despite lobbying from Davidson head coach Bob McKillop and Charleston coach Bobby Cremins, the Wildcats failed to get an NCAA tournament bid. Instead, they received the sixth seed in the 2009 NIT. Davidson played the third seed, South Carolina, on the road in the first round. Curry scored 32 points as the Wildcats beat the Gamecocks 70-63. Davidson would then fall 68-80 to the Saint Mary's Gaels in the second round. Curry registered 26 points, 9 rebounds, and 5 assists in what was his final game for the Wildcats.

He finished his final season at Davidson averaging 28.6 points, 5.6 assists, and 2.5 steals. He was the NCAA scoring leader and was named a consensus first team All-American. Although he opted out of his senior year at Davidson, Curry stated that he still planned to earn his degree.

Professional career

Golden State Warriors (2009-present)

2009-10 season

The Golden State Warriors selected Curry with the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft. He subsequently signed a four-year, $12.7 million contract in July 2009. Curry made his NBA regular season debut on October 28, 2009 in the Warriors' 2009-10 season opener against the Houston Rockets. He started the game and finished with 14 points, 7 assists, 4 steals and 2 turnovers in 36 minutes of play.

On February 10, 2010, Curry got his first career triple-double when he recorded 36 points, 13 assists, and 10 rebounds. On April 7, 2010, Curry recorded 27 points, 14 assists, 8 rebounds and 7 steals as then-head coach Don Nelson set a new NBA record for career coaching wins with 1,333.

Curry was a contender for the 2009-10 NBA Rookie of the Year Award, but ended up finishing second behind Tyreke Evans. He was one of three unanimous selections to the All-Rookie First Team, alongside Evans and Brandon Jennings. Curry averaged 17.5 points, 4.5 rebounds, 5.9 assists, and 1.9 steals for the season.

2010-11 season

Curry averaged 18.6 points, 3.9 rebounds, 5.8 assists, 1.5 steals on the season. During the 2011 NBA All-Star Weekend, he won the Skills Challenge. Curry led the NBA in free-throw percentage and set a new Warriors single-season record by shooting 93.4%, passing Rick Barry's previous mark of 92.4%. He was also the recipient of the 2010-11 NBA Sportsmanship Award.

2011-12 season: Injury-riddled season

In May 2011, Curry had surgery on his right ankle to repair torn ligaments he got from multiple sprains during the 2010-11 season. He was ready to play by the start of the lockout-shortened season with his new head coach Mark Jackson, but he sprained his surgically repaired right ankle during an exhibition game just days before the season started. He still started the season opener vs. the Los Angeles Clippers, but had only 4 points on 2-of-12 shooting. The next game, Curry had 21 points and 10 assists to lead the Warriors to a 99-91 victory over the Chicago Bulls, but rolled his right ankle and missed the next game. He came back for 3 games and sprained his right ankle yet again on January 4. He returned January 20 for the next 16 games before straining a tendon in his right foot in a game on February 22. On March 5, Curry returned for 4 games before having season-ending arthroscopic surgery on his right ankle. The injury-plagued season ended with Curry seeing action in only 26 of 66 games with averages of 14.7 points, 3.4 rebounds, 5.3 assists, and 1.5 steals.

2012-13 season

On October 31, 2012, Curry agreed to a four-year, $44 million rookie scale contract extension with the Warriors. He went on to average 22.9 points, 4.0 rebounds, 6.9 assists and 1.6 steals per game on the season.

On February 27, 2013, Curry scored a career-high 54 points in a 109-105 loss to the New York Knicks. He shot 18 for 28 from the field, and 11 of 13 from three-point range. His 11 three-pointers is a single-game franchise-record and trails only the 12 threes made by Kobe Bryant and Donyell Marshall for most threes made in a single game in NBA history. On the final day of the regular season, Curry broke the NBA record for three-pointers made in a single regular season. Curry finished the season with 272 made three pointers; 3 more than previous record holder Ray Allen.

Golden State finished 47-35, earning the sixth seed in the 2013 NBA Playoffs and a matchup with the three seeded Denver Nuggets in the first round. This was the first playoff series for Curry and many of his teammates but Golden State beat Denver in six games to advance to the semifinals to face the San Antonio Spurs. Curry had a playoff career-high 44 points in Game 1 of the series but the Warriors ended up blowing a 16-point lead late in the fourth quarter which resulted in a double-overtime loss. Golden State would go on to lose to the eventual Western Conference champion San Antonio Spurs in six games.

2013-14 season

On December 7, 2013, in a 108-82 win over the Memphis Grizzlies, Curry broke Jason Richardson's franchise record for most three-point field goals made in a career with 701, doing so in fewer attempts.

Curry made his first All-Star appearance after he was voted by the fans as a starter for the Western Conference. He finished the season averaging 24.0 points and 8.5 assists; both career bests.

The Golden State Warriors finished with a 51-31 record and was the 6th seed in the Western Conference once again. They would face the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round. On April 27, 2014, in Game 4 of the series, Curry scored 33 points, including a then playoff career-high seven three-pointers, as the Warriors beat the Clippers 118-97. Curry and the Warriors would go on to lose to the Clippers in seven games in the midst of the Donald Sterling controversy. He was named to the All-NBA Second Team for the first time.

2014-15 season: MVP and first championship

On January 7, 2015, in a 117-102 win over the Indiana Pacers, Curry made his 1,000th career three-point field goal. He became the fastest player in NBA history to make 1,000 career three-pointers. It was Curry's 369th game; 88 fewer games than previous record-holder Dennis Scott (457) took to reach the milestone. On February 4, he scored a season-high 51 points on 16-of-26 shooting in a 128-114 win over the Dallas Mavericks.

Curry was the overall leading vote-getter for the 2015 NBA All-Star Game, edging last year's top vote-getter, LeBron James.

On February 14, 2015, Curry defeated teammate Klay Thompson and six others to win his first three-point contest during the 2015 NBA All-Star Weekend. Curry also wore sneakers that had Deah Shaddy Barakat's name on them (one of the victims of the 2015 Chapel Hill shooting). According to his sister Suzanne, Deah Barakat was known for his "love for basketball and anything Steph Curry." Deah's number for his intramural basketball team at North Carolina State University was Curry's No. 30 and he posed for a photo that was similar to one that Curry did for GQ. Curry said that Barakat's family "did a great job of reaching out to me and making me aware of the details of his life and personality … It was really kind of a cool deal to be able to use the platform yesterday to honor Deah and his family … I’m going to send them the shoes I wore yesterday. And hopefully they know that I’ve been thinking about them.”

On April 9, 2015, Curry knocked down his 273rd three-pointer of the season, topping the mark of 272 he set in 2012-13. He finished the game with eight three-pointers and 45 total points as he helped the Warriors rally to a 116-105 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers. On May 4, he was named the recipient of the Maurice Podoloff Trophy as the 2014-15 NBA Most Valuable Player, joining Wilt Chamberlain as the only MVP winners in Warriors' franchise history (Chamberlain won the award during the 1959-60 season with what were then the Philadelphia Warriors). Despite only playing 32.7 minutes per game during the season, Curry ranked first in free throw percentage, third in three point percentage and steals per game, and sixth in points and assists per game.

On May 13, 2015, in a 98-78 win over the Memphis Grizzlies in Game 5 of the Western Conference semi-finals, Curry became the fastest player to make 100 three-pointers in the playoffs, reaching the milestone in 28 games. Ray Allen held the previous record at 35. In addition, Curry became the first player in NBA history to have six three-pointers and six steals in a single playoff game. Three days later, in the series-clinching Game 6 victory, Curry made a playoff career-high 8 three-pointers, en route to 32 points, including a buzzer-beater from behind half-court. Curry propelled the Warriors to their first Western Conference Finals since 1976. On May 23, in a 115-80 win over the Houston Rockets in Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals, Curry broke the record for three-pointers made in a single post-season with his 59th coming in just 13 games. Reggie Miller set the previous mark of 58 in 2000 in 22 games. Curry went on to lead the Warriors to victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2015 NBA Finals with 26.0 points, 5.2 rebounds, 6.3 assists and 1.8 steals in the six-game series that the Warriors won 4-2.

2015-16 season

On October 27, 2015, Curry scored 40 points (including a career-high 24 points in the first quarter) in the Warriors' season opening win over the New Orleans Pelicans, the most points scored by a reigning MVP in an opener since 1972 when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar scored 41 for the Milwaukee Bucks. In addition, Curry started his seventh straight season opener, joining Jeff Mullins and Chris Mullin as the only Warriors' players since 1962 to do so. Two games later on October 31, also against the Pelicans, Curry scored 53 points on 17-of-27 shooting to lead the Warriors to a 134-120 win. Curry became the first player since Michael Jordan in 1989 - 90 to score 118 points in the first three games of a season. He was subsequently named the Western Conference Player of the Week. On November 12, he scored 46 points on 15-of-25 shooting, including 8-of-13 from three-point range, leading the Warriors to a 10-0 start with a 129-116 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves.

On November 14 against the Brooklyn Nets, Curry passed his father on the NBA's list of career three-point field goals made. He moved to 41st all-time in just 427 games, while Dell needed 1,083 games to reach 1,245 three-pointers. After scoring 20 points or more in the Warriors' first 14 games of the season, Curry scored 19 in a November 22 win over the Denver Nuggets, helping Golden State tie the NBA record of 15 wins to start a season, matching the 1948-49 Washington Capitols and the 1993-94 Houston Rockets. On November 24, he scored 24 points in a win over the Los Angeles Lakers as the Warriors set the record for best start in NBA history at 16-0.

National team career

Curry is a two-time gold medalist as a member of the United States national team in both 2010 and 2014. He is also a silver medalist with the Under-19 USA team in 2007.

Personal life

On July 30, 2011, Curry married Ayesha Alexander in Charlotte, North Carolina. The couple has two daughters, one born in 2012, and one born 2015.  They live in Orinda, California.

Curry is a Christian. Curry spoke about his faith during his MVP speech by saying, "People should know who I represent and why I am who I am, and that's because of my Lord and Savior." He also said the reason that he pounds his chest and points up is that he has a "heart for God" and as a reminder that he plays for God. On some of his "Curry One" basketball shoes, there is a lace loop scripted "4:13". It is a reference to the Bible verse Philippians 4:13. Curry has a tattoo of First Corinthians, 13:8 in Hebrew on his wrist.

Curry's younger brother, Seth, is also a professional basketball player; while his younger sister, Sydel, plays volleyball at Elon University.

Curry wears the same No. 30 his dad wore while he was in the NBA.

During the 1992 All-Star Weekend, his father entrusted him to Biserka Petrović, mother of future Hall of Fame player Dražen Petrović, while Dell competed in the Three-Point Shootout. Following the 2015 NBA Finals, Curry gave Biserka one of his Finals-worn jerseys, which will reportedly be added to the collection of the Dražen Petrović Memorial Center, a museum to the late player in the Croatian capital of Zagreb.
