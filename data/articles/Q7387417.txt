S. Curtis "Curt" Johnson is the son of Samuel Curtis Johnson, Jr., who died in 2004, and Imogene Powers Johnson and the great great grandson of S. C. Johnson & Son founder Samuel Curtis Johnson, Sr.. The 2013 Forbes 400 list of richest persons in the world placed him at 166 with a net worth of $3 billion, in a 5-way tie for this place, with his equally rich mother, two sisters, and brother (all of whom live in Racine, except one sister).

He was the chairman of the Diversey, Inc. subsidiary of Johnson Family Enterprises. He resigned that position in early 2011 citing "personal reasons", however his bail conditions stated he was allowed to leave the state to conduct business. His sister, Helen Johnson-Leipold now heads the firm.

Criminal conviction

On 24 March 2011, Johnson was charged in Racine County Circuit Court with sexually assaulting his step-daughter over a period of three years, starting from when she was 12 years old. Johnson's alleged activities came to light when his Arizona therapist notified law enforcement, saying Johnson told the counselor about the sexual abuse in his therapy sessions. Text from the official criminal complaint document states that the girl “finally told her mother about what was happening to her because she wanted to protect her younger sisters.”  On August 22 of 2011, Racine Circuit Judge Eugene Gasiorkiewicz altered the conditions of his bond to allow the billionaire to travel out of state to see his wife, attend counseling sessions, and conduct business within the continental United States. The billionaire   was released on a $500,000 cash bond and ordered to have no contact with any female child. If convicted of the felony charges he could have been sentenced to as much as forty years in prison.

The trial continued, including a recent court date of January 6, 2014. The Racine judge for his trial (Gasiorkiewicz) has extended special actions for this particular case, calling for monthly conference calls with lawyers on both sides beginning with a conference call with the judge on February 11, 2014, to check on the progress of the case.

In June 2014, Johnson pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors. The victim had moved to North Carolina and wanted the case dismissed as well as fought efforts to make her appear and testify. Johnson was sentenced to four months in jail with Huber privileges after 60 days and fined $6,000. He will not have to register as a sex offender.

Political donations

Curtis Johnson gave the Republican National Committee (RNC) $15,000 on June 2009. In 2008, he donated $1,000 to the RNC. He gave a total of $2,000 to Representative Paul Ryan, in four separate donations. 

The S.C. Johnson and Sons political action committee (PAC) donated $99,700 in 2010 alone. In 2008 it donated $94,125 and similar amounts in previous years.
