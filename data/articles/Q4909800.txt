Following his graduation from Auburn, he and his older brother, John M. Harbert, founded Harbert Construction Company. The company, which later changed its name to Harbert Corporation, became one of the world's largest construction and engineering companies. In the early 1990s Harbert Corporation sold its domestic construction division to Raytheon in an effort to focus more investment management. Soon after, the international division was sold to Bill Harbert. The international division was renamed Bill Harbert International. In 2000 the company changed its name to B.L. Harbert International and is headed by Bill's son Billy Harbert.

On June 27, 2010, Harbert died at the age of 86 in Birmingham, Alabama. He was survived by his son Bill L. Harbert Jr. and his daughters Anne Harbert Moulton, and Elizabeth Harbert Cornay. Harbert had six grandchildren, one being his namesake, Billy Harbert Moulton, age 24.
