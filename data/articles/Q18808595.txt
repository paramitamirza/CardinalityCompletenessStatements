Kristi Funk (born September 22, 1969) is an American breast cancer surgeon notable for her surgical treatment of celebrities Angelina Jolie and Sheryl Crow. Funk opened the Pink Lotus Breast Center in 2009 with her husband, venture capitalist Andy Funk. 

On May 14 2013, the same day Jolie publicly disclosed in a New York Times op-ed her BRCA mutation status and the prophylactic mastectomy she underwent earlier that year, Funk released a blog post about Jolie's procedure in which she outlined the stages of surveillance and treatment that were followed in her case.
