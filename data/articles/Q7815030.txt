Thomas Matthew Bradby (born 13 January 1967) is a British journalist and novelist best known as Political Editor for ITV News from 2005 to 2015, the current main presenter of News at Ten and host of the political discussion series The Agenda with Tom Bradby.

Early life and family

Bradby was born in Malta in 1967. After a short spell in Gibraltar he moved to Britain and was educated at Westbourne House School, Sherborne School and the University of Edinburgh. In 1994, he married Claudia, the daughter of Vice-Admiral Hon. Sir Nicholas John Hill-Norton.

Career

Bradby has worked for ITN, producer of ITV News, since 1990 when he joined the organisation as an editorial trainee. He subsequently became producer for ITV's political editor Michael Brunson in 1992.

From 1993 to 1996, Bradby was ITV's Ireland correspondent, reporting on events including the Northern Ireland peace process, the IRA ceasefire and Bill Clinton's visit to Ireland in November 1995. Bradby later became ITV's Asia correspondent from 1999 to 2001. In October 1999, he was injured whilst covering the riots in Jakarta against the newly elected President, Abdurrahman Wahid. He was hit in the leg by a flare attached to a chain as demonstrators clashed with armed police in the Indonesian capital. He underwent a three-hour operation for a compound fracture of his fibula and spent several days in a Jakarta hospital before flying home to Hong Kong to convalesce.

Bradby returned to the UK and began a stint as royal correspondent, covering a number of key stories, including the Queen's Jubilee year, as well as the deaths of the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret. He later became UK editor and then political editor, taking on the role in 2005.

On 16 November 2010, Bradby carried out the first official interview of Prince William and Catherine Middleton at St James's Palace after the couple's engagement was announced. It was reported that Bradby was chosen specifically to conduct the interview owing to a long-standing acquaintance with Prince William. He subsequently attended William and Catherine's wedding as a guest.

Bradby has since transitioned from reporter to presenter for a variety of programmes: In February 2012, ITV launched a weekly political discussion programme, The Agenda, hosted by Bradby; in August 2013, Bradby presented an edition of News at Ten for the first time; and in May 2015, he presented ITV's main coverage of the 2015 general election. In October 2015, Bradby took over as the sole main newscaster of the flagship News at Ten.
