Background

Rebney attended Ohio University on a football scholarship and then attended law school. Rebney did legal work in construction-defect then moved to the sports-law firm Steinberg Moorad & Dunn.  

Bellator MMA

Rebney's passion was for Mixed Martial Arts, which made him decide to start a MMA promotion. In his search for investors to fund his idea of a MMA promotion, Rebney had sixty-one investor meetings within 16 months. To fund these trips to meet with investors and fighters, Rebney spent his savings and took out a second and third mortgage on his home.  In Rebney's 62nd meeting with investors, he met executives at Plainfield Asset Management, who were familiar with the sport from prior meetings with management of EliteXC and the International Fight League who wanted capital to stay in business. After a follow-up meeting in New York, Plainfield agreed to provide the capital which led to the creation of Bellator Fighting Championships.

On June 18, 2014, it was announced by Spike TV that Rebney has parted ways with the company.

Personal Life

Rebney's father is Jack Rebney, subject of the documentary Winnebago Man (2009). 

Rebney is married to Huma Gruaz, an advertising and public relations executive. The couple have two children, Jonathan and Celine.
