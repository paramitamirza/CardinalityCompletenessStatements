Balagopalan M.A. (1986), Gandhinagar 2nd Street (1986), Nadodikkattu (1987), Varavelpu (1989), Mazhavilkavadi (1989), Sasneham (1990), Sandesam (1991), Santhanagopalam (1994), Thooval Kottaram (1996), Veendum Chila Veettukaryangal (1999), Kochu Kochu Santhoshangal (2000), Manassinakkare (2003), and Rasatanthram (2006). Actors Mohanlal and Jayaram embodied the typical Sathyan Anthikkad protagonist in most of the films. On the other hand, Sathyan Anthikad had tried making movies in different genres as well but because of their lower success rate at the box-office he hasn't pursued to make more of them. Some of his such films include Pappan Priyappetta Pappan (1986), Artham (1989), and Pingami (1994).

Personal life

Satyan was born to M.V. Krishnan and M.K. Kalyani at Anthikad in Thrissur district of Kerala. He is married to Nimmi Sathyan and has three sons.

Career

In 1973, Sathyan debuted as an assistant director to Dr. Balakrishnan in Rekha Cine Arts. He was the Associate Director Of director P. Chandrakumar for more than twenty films till 1982.He also assisted director Jeassy in few films. Sathyan kickstarted his film direction with Kurukkante Kalyanam in 1982. The legend has it that he started shooting his first film in 1981, named Chamayam. Due to some unfortunate series of events this movie was never completed. He teamed up with Sreenivasan and made some of the most memorable films in Malayalam film history, with Sreenivasan as the screenwriter. Thalayanamanthram, Nadodikkattu and Sandesam are some of the films born from this team, covering socially relevant matters with a comic touch. Sathyan made two novels into films: Appunni starring Mohanlal (a film adaptation of V. K. N.'s novel) and Irattakkuttikalude Achan starring Jayaram and Manju Warrier (an adaptation of C. V. Balakrishnan's novel). Of late, he has ventured into screenwriting and made films like Rasathanthram, Vinodayathra, Innathe Chintha Vishayam and Bhagyadevatha, with credits of story, dialogues and screenplay.

He is a favourite of family filmgoers because of his selection of plots in family-life backgrounds with social relevance and because of his comedic tastes.

Recurring collaborators

Sathyan Anthikad often includes certain actors and technicians more than once in his films. Innocent holds the record of working in maximum films with Sathyan Anthikad. He rarely makes movies without Innocent in the cast. Oduvil Unnikrishnan, Mamukkoya, Nedumudi Venu and K. P. A. C. Lalitha are common cast in his films. His association with screenwriter and actor Sreenivasan's is one of the most successful combinations in Malayalam cinema. Among the lead actors, he has worked with Mohanlal the most, closely followed by Jayaram. The trio of Sathyan, Mohanlal and Sreenivasan have produced some of the most memorable hits in Malayalam cinema.

Either Vipin Mohan or Venu has served as cinematographer for almost all of Anthikkad's films. Johnson has provided music for most all his films till Veendum Chila Veettukaryangal. Their combination is said to be one of the most successful in Malayalam film history. Many memorable songs and film scores of nineties emerged from this combo. In Kochu Kochu Santhoshangal, Anthikkad roped in one of his favourite composers Ilaiyaraaja to compose music. However, he returned to Johnson himself for his next films Narendran Makan Jayakanthan Vaka and Yathrakarude Sradhakku. He again brought back Ilaiyaraja in Manassinakkare, as Johnson took a sabattical from film scoring.
