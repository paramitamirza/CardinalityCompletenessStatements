Katie Griffin (born January 14, 1973) is a Canadian actress and singer. She was involved in a bunch of television movies and feature films. In cartoons, her best-known roles include the voices of Sailor Mars in the original English dub of Sailor Moon, and Alex in Totally Spies!. She is also the voice of Laugh-a-Lot Bear in Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot and as a plush toy.

Biography

Griffin grew up in Scarborough, Ontario. Her mother was a teacher, and her father was an air traffic controller. When she was 8, she played the role of The Artful Dodger in her school play, which garnered notice from her mother, who was the school director, of her talent. Looking back at that period, Griffin said that she was more inspired by watching movies than theatre, especially concerning strong women, and cited her mom as a huge influence.

Griffin got her break into acting when she was 15 when she participated in a play at the Ryerson Theatre and was noticed by an agent. She was booked for local commercials and television spots in Canada as well as television movie specials. After graduating high school, she switched agents and continued with her acting gigs. When she was attending Ryerson University, she was offered a role in the television film "Up to Now" but it caused a conflict where she had to choose between acting or studying.

Griffin's first major role in an animated series was Sailor Mars in Sailor Moon, which at the time she had not realized it was going to be popular. She was recommended to audition by Rino Romano, who voiced Tuxedo Mask. She described the role with Serena as best friends who sometimes fight, but not really the bully persona that was shown. She would record about two to three episodes a week, and it was not difficult on her voice. She likes that Mars is "fiercely loyal, strong, loves martial arts, sings... and the fact that she can summon fire and destroy evil, lol, Rei and I are very similar in character."

In the animated TV series Braceface, Griffin voices Nina, a mean eighth-grader girl who gives the title character her moniker. In the Moon Chase interview, Griffin said "I donâ€™t think I have one single thing in common with Nina, so it was fun playing that role. I guess in the end, I like playing badass kind of characters."

In voicing Alex in Totally Spies!, Griffin used a higher vocal register than usual. She was worried about nodules developing, and being recast when the series returned for season 6 following a hiatus, but was happy when she could return. She found the part to be really fun, easy to play, and liked that Alex was so lovely to animals. She notes that about the only thing Alex and Raye (Sailor Mars) have in common is their ability to kick some ass.

In live-action acting, she starred alongside Rob Lowe as his love interest in Too Late to Say Goodbye. She also worked with Nicole Kidman and Glenn Close.

Music career

Some of Griffin's influences in her music style include: Sarah McLachlan, Madonna, The Tragically Hip, as well as alternative music bands Hole, Foo Fighters, No Doubt, and Radiohead. She enjoys singing but realized she wasn't going to get a record deal by just that. She learned guitar and began writing songs. Following one of the commercial voice-over jobs where she sang a jingle, she played some acoustic songs and her friend suggested she get her songs produced in an album. She was introduced to Michael Kulas of the band James. Kulas was able to produce many of her acoustic songs so that they became more of a pop/rock album. The album title Kiss Me Chaos was based on the Kiss Me, Kate musical, as she describes herself as being pretty strong and like "Kate the Shrew".

Personal life

Griffin is married to Michael Kulas. They have two children. Griffin enjoys martial arts films, playing guitar, and playing/watching hockey. She has a younger sister named Becky.
