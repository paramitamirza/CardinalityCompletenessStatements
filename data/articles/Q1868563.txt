Amelia Heinle Luckinbill (n√©e Amelia March Heinle, formerly Weatherly; born March 17, 1973) is an American actress best known for her roles in American soap operas.

Early life

Amelia March Heinle was born in Phoenix, Arizona and has four younger siblings. She grew up in Arizona and moved to New Jersey with her family when she was 15 years old.

Career

From 1993-1995 she played the role of Stephanie "Steffi" Brewster on the soap opera Loving. She also played the character for two months in that show's short-lived spin off The City from November 1995 until January 1996. In 1994 she was nominated for a Soap Opera Digest Award for "Outstanding Female Newcomer".

Through the 1990s she appeared in many made for TV movies, as well as a starring role in the 1999 Steven Soderbergh film, The Limey, as Peter Fonda's girlfriend. She appeared in the music video for "I Will Buy You a New Life" by Everclear.

In 2001 she returned to the world of daytime television, this time in the role of Mia Saunders on All My Children, the heretofore unknown half-sister of Liza Colby (Marcy Walker). Although she started as a front-burner character, her romantic pairing with Jake Martin (J. Eddie Peck) didn't work out because of the actor's exit from the show, and so Mia was limited to being a background character. In 2004, Heinle opted not to renew her contract with All My Children and left the show.

On March 21, 2005, Heinle joined the cast of the CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless, as Victoria Newman, replacing the popular Heather Tom in the role. She won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2014 and again in 2015 for the role.

In April 2009 Heinle appeared in season 4, episode 20, of Ghost Whisperer, entitled "Stage Fright," with husband Thad Luckinbill and fellow daytime drama actress Lesli Kay.

Personal life

In February 1995, she married her Loving co-star and on-screen love interest, Michael Weatherly, who played the role of "Cooper Alden." On January 10, 1996, Heinle gave birth to her first child, a son. She and Weatherly divorced in 1997.

In March 2007 she married her Young and the Restless co-star, Thad Luckinbill, who portrayed her onscreen ex-husband, J.T. Hellstrom until 2010. The couple welcomed their first child together, a son, November 2, 2007. They welcomed their second child, a daughter, on December 17, 2009.
