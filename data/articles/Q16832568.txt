Kyra Zagorsky (born June 6, 1976) is a film and television actress. She has acted in the TV series Helix, the film The Pastors Wife and season 8 of the TV series Supernatural. She is married to actor Patrick Sabongui, with whom she has two children, a son named Bodhi Gabriel and daughter named Ashe Alexandria.

Zagorsky was born in New York and raised in the mountains in a small town in Colorado. She grew up in the outdoors, and was an athlete and dancer throughout school. She began acting in her senior year of high school, when she auditioned for the school musical and was cast as one of the leads. She was immediately drawn into the world of theater which would eventually dictate the course of her life.

Zagorsky went on to receive a BFA in theatre from Southern Oregon University in Ashland. In 2006 she earned a Master of Fine Arts degree in acting from the University of California, Irvine. Zagorsky has also trained in various martial arts over the years, including kickboxing, capoeira, and Filipino stick and sword fighting. This has proven to be useful in the intense fight scenes she is often cast for.

To further cultivate her passion for acting Zagorsky worked extensively in leading roles in regional theatre across the U.S. until she made the transition to TV and Film in 2007. She continued to work steadily within this new medium with guest star appearances in SyFys Continuum (TV series) in its final season, as well as Stargate: Atlantis and Stargate Universe SGU, The CWs Supernatural, FOXs Fringe, TNTs Falling Skies and in the award winning web series Divine. Zagorsky took on a lead role in the film The ABCs of Death, "a 26-chapter anthology that showcases death in all its vicious wonder and brutal beauty", which premiered at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival and in the zombie horror film Toxin 3D.

Zagorsky splits her time between Los Angeles, Vancouver, and Montreal.
