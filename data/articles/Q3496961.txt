MeShaunda "Shaun" Pizarrur Ellis (born June 24, 1977), nicknamed Big Katt, is a former American football defensive end who played twelve seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the University of Tennessee. Ellis was drafted by the New York Jets in the first round (12th overall) of the 2000 NFL Draft, and also played for the New England Patriots. He was a two-time Pro Bowl selection.

Early years

Ellis was born in Anderson, South Carolina, to mother Annie Clara Ellis. Ellis attended Westside High School in Anderson.

College career

Ellis enrolled in the University of Tennessee, where he was a stand-out defensive end for the Tennessee Volunteers football team. At the end of his college career he had 105 tackles, 12.5 sacks, three forced fumbles, a fumble recovery and one interception which he returned for 90 yards to score a touchdown.

Professional career

New York Jets (2000-2010)

Ellis was selected by the New York Jets in the first round (12th overall) of the 2000 NFL Draft. He was the first of four first round draft picks that the Jets had that year. The other players drafted were John Abraham (13th overall), Chad Pennington (18th overall) and Anthony Becht (27th overall).

Ellis was an immediate impact player and in his rookie season recorded 8.5 sacks. Only Hugh Douglas in 1995 with 10 sacks ranks higher in Jets history for most sacks by a rookie. After 2001 and 2002 campaigns which saw his overall numbers drop, Ellis rebounded in 2003 with an impressive 12.5 sacks. Ellis followed up his 2003 season with 11 sacks in 2004. Ellis anchored a strong Jets run defense which contributed to a 10-6 season and a wild card berth. He also recorded three sacks in the final game of the 2004 regular season against the St. Louis Rams.

On December 14, 2008 in a home game against the rival Buffalo Bills, Ellis recovered a J.P. Losman fumble and ran it for a touchdown in the final 2 minutes, giving the Jets the lead and the eventual 31-27 win.

On December 23, 2008, Ellis was fined $10,000 for tossing snow at opposing fans when the Jets played the Seattle Seahawks at Qwest Field the previous Sunday. Ellis claimed that it was "all in good fun." 

By 2009, Ellis was the longest tenured player on the Jets. Ellis led the Jets to the postseason where the Jets made the AFC Championship for the first time in 11 years but lost to the Indianapolis Colts 17-30.

Ellis would lead the Jets to the AFC Championship for the 2nd consecutive season in 2010 as they lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers 19-24. On January 26, 2010, Ellis was named to the 2010 Pro Bowl as a replacement for Indianapolis Colts defensive end Robert Mathis.

New England Patriots (2011)

Ellis signed with the New England Patriots on August 7, 2011, ending his 11-year tenure with the New York Jets. During the 2011 season, Ellis played in 14 games with 14 total tackles and 1 sack. The Patriots would finish the regular season with a 13-3 record and advance to Super Bowl XLVI. It was Ellis' first career trip to the Super Bowl but the Patriots lost to the Giants 21-17. Ellis was released after the 2011 season was over.

Free agency & retirement

Ellis spent most of the 2012 season on free agency and eventually announced his retirement.
