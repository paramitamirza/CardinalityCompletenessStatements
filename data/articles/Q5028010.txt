Early life

His paternal great-grandfather, Frank Davey, was a Hawaii adventurer and photographer who served the royalty in the Hawaiian Kingdom in the late 19th Century. Davey's photographs include those of Princess Kaiulani on the steps of her home at Ainahou, Hawaii and the “Lei Makers” in the early years of Honolulu. Davey’s caricature was carried in the Pacific Commercial Advertiser in their edition of June 28, 1902.

Cavasso and his family relocated to Oahu, Hawaii in October 1961, and he graduated from Kailua Elementary School, Kailua Intermediate School, and Kailua High School.
