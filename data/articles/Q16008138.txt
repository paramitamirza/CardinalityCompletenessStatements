She competed in numerous events throughout her career, including racing the Mille Miglia five times. In 1921, she famously drove a twelve-cylinder Packard 299 on the beach of the island of Fanø, in Denmark. She married her husband Eustachio Avanzo in 1908 with whom she had two children, Luisa in 1909 and Renzo in 1911. In her career she fought for the right to compete as a woman, and became an activist for equality for women and a symbol of early feminism.

Early life

Maria Antonietta Avanzo (née Bellan) was born in 1889 at Contarina, now Porto Viro, near Rovigo and learned to drive on her father's De Dion Bouton tricycle.

A young Enzo Ferrari was very impressed with her. According to Ferrari, as she emerged, Antonio Ascari overheard her remark that she'd be happy to swap it for a Fiat. On her return home she found a bright red Fiat awaiting her, and Ascari got the Packard which was repaired and put back into use. 1921, driving an Ansaldo 4CS she was Tazio Nuvolari's teammate and came in 7th (3rd in class) at the Circuito di Garda.
