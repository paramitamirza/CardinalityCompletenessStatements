Warren Davis Folkes (January 4, 1898  -  June 14, 1997) was a farmer from his native St. Francisville, Louisiana, who served in the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1944 to 1955 and again from 1968 to 1976 and in the Louisiana State Senate in the intervening years of 1955 to 1968.

Folkes was one of seven children of Cheston Folkes and the former Jessie Davis (1865-1938). Cheston Folkes was a state representative from 1908 to 1920, 1924 to 1932, and 1936 to 1940.  Warren Folkes graduated from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, when it was known as Southwestern Louisiana Industrial Institute. He was active in his hometown Grace Episcopal Church. He and his wife, the former Alice Winfield Pipes (1903-1996) had one child, Alice Folks Bankston (1935-2013), the wife of Walter Roland Bankston and the mother of four children.

Folkes left the state House after victory in a special election in 1955 for the state Senate vacancy created by the death in 1954 of E. M. Toler, a long-time East Feliciana Parish physician from Clinton. Folkes returned to the House in 1968 for the West Feliciana Parish district and also from 1972 to 1976 was part of the nine-member delegation from East Baton Rouge Parish. 

Folkes, his wife, daughter, and other family members are interred at the Grace Episcopal Church Cemetery in St. Francisville.
