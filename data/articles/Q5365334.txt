Ellie Crisell (born 19 July 1976) is an English journalist and television presenter working for the BBC. Crisell currently presents the BBC One 8pm news summary, and is a relief presenter on the BBC News Channel. She was formerly the main presenter of children's news bulletin programme Newsround on CBBC and Newsround Extra.

Early life

Crisell attended Dame Allan's Girls School, Newcastle upon Tyne, before going on to the University of Birmingham, then achieving an MA in Broadcast Journalism at London's City University.

Career

Crisell worked for The Mail on Sunday for a year, and then for a year in radio. She then worked for the ITV regional station, Tyne Tees Television, as a reporter and newsreader for North East Tonight. 

Newsround

She started as a Newsround presenter in February 2003 shortly after previous chief anchor Becky Jago's departure. Significant stories which Crisell was involved in reporting included the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami in which she travelled to Indonesia to see in person the effects of the disaster. She also travelled to Athens in Greece to give daily reports on the 2004 Summer Olympics. In addition to serious reports, she also presented more light-hearted stories, including a report on the Harry Potter-inspired rise of magic in the UK that ended with her being sawn in half by a magician in an illusion called Clearly Impossible. 

Crisell has not presented Newsround since returning from maternity leave, and her profile has been taken off the show's website.

BBC News

On 12 September 2006, Crisell appeared on Newsnight, her first non-sports based appearance on BBC News adult-orientated output. 

In November 2006 Crisell started relief presenting for BBC News.

Following a second maternity leave in 2015, Crisell began presenting South East Today as a stand-in presenter from July onwards.
