Position at court

One moiety part of the ancient office of Lord Great Chamberlain is a Cholmondeley inheritance.  This hereditary honour came into the Cholmondeley family through the marriage of the first Marquess of Cholmondeley to Lady Georgiana Charlotte Bertie, daughter of Peregrine Bertie, 3rd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven.  The second, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh holders of the marquessate have all held this office.
