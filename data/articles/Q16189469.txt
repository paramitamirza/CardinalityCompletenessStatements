William D. Reilich (born 1957) is an American politician best known for having served as a New York State Assemblyman. As of 2014, he serves as Supervisor of the Town of Greece.

Reilich is a small businessman who founded an alarm systems company in 1975 which he eventually sold. He now owns Rochester Auto Design.

Reilich began his political career by serving on the Greece, New York zoning and environment boards, eventually becoming the GOP chair for the Town of Greece.  In the early 1990s, he considered running for the Monroe County, New York legislature, but his campaign failed to materialize when redistricting required by the 1990 census left him without a seat for which to run. In 1997 he was picked by the Republican members of the county legislature, to succeed John T. Auberger who resigned to become Greece town supervisor.

While in the legislature, Reilich served on the Planning and Economic Development Committee and rose to become the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. He also served on the board of the County of Monroe Industrial Development Agency (COMIDA).

Reilich successfully defended his county legislative seat in 1999 and ran unopposed in 2001.

He was elected to the New York State Assembly in 2002.

In November 2013, Reilich was elected to serve as the Supervisor for the Town of Greece.

In Town of Greece v. Galloway, the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of the practice of opening town meetings with a prayerâ€”a practice Reilich continued from his predecessor.
