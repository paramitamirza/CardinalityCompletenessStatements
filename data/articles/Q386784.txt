Quinn achieved more public recognition when he auditioned for the third series of The X Factor in 2006, eventually becoming a fan favourite and finishing in second place behind Leona Lewis.

Ray won the fourth series of Dancing on Ice in 2009 and the final 'All Stars' series in 2014. On 22 February 2015, he was the winner for the first series of Get Your Act Together.

At the age of six, he started dancing lessons at the Chiltern School of Dance and Drama, under the guidance and teaching of Colette Byatt.

Career

2000-05: Career beginnings in acting

From 2000 to 2003, Quinn portrayed the role of victimised yet tormented child Anthony Murray in the Channel 4 soap opera, Brookside. He performed and was credited under his full name, Raymond Quinn. Murray's featured storylines on the programme included bullying and murder. The child killing became a controversial subject on television and in the media, to which some people have called it one of the most shocking storylines in British television history. His dramatic performance as Murray was well received by critics and fans.

After his appearance on Brookside ended, he guest starred in an episode of Merseybeat, in which he played criminal Leon Marsh. He also appeared in the episode "The Singing Cactus" for the BBC series, The Afternoon Play as John Reilly, who grieves after his mother's death and flees into his own world with his "singing cactus".  

2006: The X Factor

Quinn rose to further prominence when he auditioned for the third series of The X Factor, singing a medley of "Ain't That a Kick in the Head?" and "Devil in Disguise". Prior to appearing on the show, he was a performing arts student at the Merseyside Dance and Drama College, where he previously received some vocal training. He received three yeses from the judges, and progressed through to bootcamp. Quinn was placed in the 16-24s category, with Simon Cowell as his mentor. However, whilst singing in front of Cowell and Sinitta, he partially stumbled and forgot the lyrics to "Easy" by Lionel Richie. Initially, he was told he wasn't progressing through to judges' houses, but a change within the series format allowed him to successfully continue with the competition. He later sang "Smile" for his judges' houses performance, and afterwards was granted a place as one of the four acts through to the live shows.

During the live shows, many of Quinn's song choices and performances were old-fashioned and swing-based. Louis Walsh and Sharon Osbourne, in the earlier stages of the competition, queried him over his ability as a pure singer rather than a 'song-and-dance' man. However, in the later stages, he widened the range of his performances more into singing pop songs, and to which the judges were satisfied with Quinn's ability to do so. In week five, he was placed in the bottom two against Nikitta Angus, but swiftly survived elimination. He managed to progress through the competition up to week 10, where he was the series runner-up, losing to eventual winner Leona Lewis.

2007: Doing It My Way, breakthrough and label drop

In December 2006, two days after finishing on The X Factor, Quinn signed a record deal with Cowell's label Sony BMG to release a debut swing album.

His debut album, Doing It My Way was released on 12 March 2007. Coincidentally, another X Factor finalist Ben Mills released his album on the same day. The album became a critical and commercial success. It entered the UK Album Chart at number one, and sold 127,000 copies in its first week of release, before being certified platinum.The album also featured covers of old swing and vocal jazz classics, some of which were recorded by Frank Sinatra himself. Quinn made British music history as he was the youngest male solo artist and the first person ever, to have a number one album without releasing a single.

During the summer of that year, he was a judge on the ITV dance competition show Baby Ballroom, alongside Bonnie Langford and Pierre Dulaine. The programme centered on finding the best junior ballroom dancers.
