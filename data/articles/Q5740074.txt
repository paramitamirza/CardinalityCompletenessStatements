Herman Ossian Armour (March 7, 1837 - September 8, 1901) was an American businessman and philanthropist, who with his brother, Philip Danforth Armour, co-founded the meatpacking firm of Armour & Company, which would exist as the nations largest such company for much of the 20th century.

Born the seventh of eight children in Stockbridge, New York, his parents were Methodists of English and Scotch ancestry. In 1865, Armour established the  New York syndicate of Armour Meats under the name Armour, Plankinton & Co. This move was prompted by a series of restrictive laws regarding lines of credit in effect throughout most Midwestern states at the time. American forebear of the Armour family,  Scotsman James Armour, was among the earliest to settle in the newly established British colony of New Jersey, arriving just three years after its establishment in 1664, though settlers from Holland, Germany, Sweden, and France had been living in the area since 1614 in the former New Netherland and New Sweden (Nya Sverige) colonies. Armour died on September 8, 1901 at his  New York City home and was laid to rest at the family mausoleum in Woodlawn Cemetery.
