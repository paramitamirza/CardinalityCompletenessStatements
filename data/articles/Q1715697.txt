Jørn Lyseggen (born December 1, 1968) is a Norwegian entrepreneur, patent inventor and the current CEO of Meltwater Group. He was born in Korea.

Career

Lyseggen established an internet consultancy company in 1995, which reportedly counted Norwegian media entrepreneur Knut Ivar Skeid as one of its clients.

In 2001, Lyseggen established Meltwater News, a B2B online media monitoring service. This has since grown into Meltwater Group, a company with more than 50 offices, 1000+ employees, and more than 22,000 global clients. It has evolved into a software as a service (SaaS) company, providing cloud-based computing solutions. The firm started off with just $15,000 in funding.

In 2008, Lyseggen and Meltwater Foundation created the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (MEST) in Accra, Ghana. MEST gives its trainees the tools they need to start new computer software companies that can compete in the global marketplace. MEST receives an annual funding of $2 million from Meltwater, an agreement that ends in 2020.
