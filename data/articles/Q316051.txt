Lars Sven "Lasse" Hallström (; born 2 June 1946) is a Swedish film director and screenwriter. He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director for My Life as a Dog (Mitt liv som hund) (1985) and later for The Cider House Rules (1999).

Early life

Hallström was born in Stockholm, Sweden. His father was a dentist and his mother was the writer Karin Lyberg (1907-2000). His maternal grandfather, Ernst Lyberg, was the Minister of Finance in the first cabinet of Carl Gustaf Ekman (1926-1928) and leader of the Liberal Party of Sweden (1930-1933).

Career

A young Hallström attended Adolf Fredrik's Music School in Stockholm. He made his directorial debut in 1973, directing the comedy series "Pappas pojkar" for Swedish TV. The collaboration with comedian actors Magnus Härenstam and Brasse Brännström was fruitful with frequent collaborations during his Swedish period. He learned his craft making music videos, in particular for ABBA. Since the international success of My Life as a Dog (1985), for which he was nominated for Academy Awards for writing and directing, Hallström has worked in American movies. His first American film was Once Around. His first notable American success was What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993). He was nominated for an Academy Award for best director for The Cider House Rules (1999) and then later directed Chocolat (2000), both of which were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

His 2012 film The Hypnotist was selected as the Swedish entry for the Best Foreign Language Oscar at the 85th Academy Awards, but it did not make the final shortlist.

Other work

Almost all of ABBA's promotional films were directed and shot by Hallström, with the only (seven total) exceptions being "When I Kissed the Teacher" (1977); "Chiquitita" (1979), which was made by the BBC; "I Have a Dream" (1979); "On and On and On" (1980); "Lay All Your Love on Me" (1981) (Made by recycling material from older videos); "The Day Before You Came" (1982) and "Under Attack" (1982), which were both directed by Kjell Sundvall and Kjell-Åke Andersson. The films for "Knowing Me, Knowing You" (1977), "Happy New Year" (1980) and "One of Us" (1981) all contained substantial scenes shot in Hallström's own Stockholm apartment. In 1999, Hallström also directed the music video for Northern Line's debut single "Run for Your Life".

Personal life

Hallström married media personality and actress Malou Hallström (died 3 February 2005) in 1974, with whom he has one child, Johan (born 1976). The couple divorced in 1981. In 1990 he met actress Lena Olin; they married on 18 March 1994. The couple currently reside in Bedford, New York, and raise two children, Tora (born 1995) and, a child from Lena Olin's first marriage, producer and director F. Auguste Rahmberg (born 1986). They also have a home located in the Stockholm archipelago.

Hallström is vegan.
