Biography

Early years

Vanessa Paradis was born in Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, France, to interior designers Corinne and André Paradis.

1983-1991

She recorded her first single, "La Magie des surprises-parties", in 1983 and performed it in an Italian festival in 1985. Although not a hit, it paved the way for the song with which she became internationally famous, "Joe le taxi", in 1987 when she was 14. It was No. 1 in France for 11 weeks and, unusually for a song sung in French, was released in the United Kingdom, where it reached No. 3. It was taken from her first album M&J (it stands for Marilyn & John) which, although it placed 13th in France, drew little attention in the UK and did not enter the chart.

In March 1989, at age 16, she left high school to pursue her career.
