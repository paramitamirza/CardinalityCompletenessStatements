Yasmin Le Bon (née Parvaneh; born 29 October 1964) is a British model.  Le Bon was one of the highest earning models during the 1980s.

Early life

Yasmin Parvaneh was born in Oxford, England, the youngest child of an Iranian father and an English mother.

She modelled for a local agency while she attended school, and after leaving signed with Models 1 Agency in London.

Career

In April 1987, she was hired by Guess? for an advertising campaign. Throughout the late 1980s, she appeared on the cover of the first American and British issues of Elle. She has also been on the covers of Vogue, V, I.D., Cosmopolitan, Marie Claire and Harper's Bazaar.

In spring 2001, Le Bon modelled bikinis for Marks & Spencer. In 2003, she signed an exclusive deal with designer Matthew Williamson and his sponsor, Ariel Essential.

As a model, Le Bon has also represented Ann Taylor, Banana Republic, Bergdorf Goodman, Biotherm, Bloomingdale's, Bonwit Teller, Calvin Klein, Versace, Chanel, Christian Dior, Clairol, Escada, Filene's, Frasercard, Avon and Gianfranco Ferré.

In January 2012, Le Bon wore a gown weighing 50 kg in the Stéphane Rolland spring/summer Haute Couture show in Paris.

Designing

In September 2009, Le Bon partnered with Wallis to design her first women's clothing and jewellery collection called YLB. Her second collection was launched in March 2010.

Other endeavors

Le Bon was invited to be one of the drivers in the 2013 Mille Miglia race in Italy. Each year, the three-day event passes through nearly 200 Italian towns from Brescia to Rome and back, recreating the original races which took place between 1927 and 1957. She and her co-driver, David Gandy, were part of “Team Jaguar”, driving a 1950 model XK120. Early in the race, Le Bon and Gandy were “pushed off the road by a competitor” which caused body damage to the wing and side of the vintage car. They re-entered the race, ultimately finishing in 158th place out of 415 cars.

Personal life

In 1984, she met Simon Le Bon, lead singer of Duran Duran. They married on 27 December 1985 in her hometown of Oxford. The couple have three daughters: Amber (born August 1989), Saffron Sahara (born September 1991) and Talullah Pine (born September 1994).
