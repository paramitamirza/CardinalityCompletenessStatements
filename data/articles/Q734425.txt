Eamonn Christopher Coghlan (born 21 November 1952) is an Irish Senator and former athlete, who specialised in middle distance track events and the 5000 metres. He is a 3-time Olympian and former World Champion in the 5000 m.

Born in Drimnagh, a successful amateur running career in Ireland led to a scholarship in the United States, where he won four NCAA titles in track running and ran a sub-four-minute mile to set an Irish record at 22 years of age. He soon set the European record over the distance. His speciality was the indoor mile run - he gained his nickname, "The Chairman of the Boards", as a result of his great success on the US indoor circuit. He broke the indoor mile world record on three occasions, and also set the world record over 1500 and 2,000m m.

He finished fourth in the 1500 m at the 1976 Summer Olympics, finished fourth again in the 5000 m at the 1980 Summer Olympics, and made the 5000 m semi-final in his last Olympic appearance at the 1988 Summer Games. He experienced greater success in the 1500 m at the European Athletics Championships: he won the 1500 m at the 1979 European Athletics Indoor Championships, and outdoors took silver in the event at the 1978 European Athletics Championships. He was also the 5000 m champion at the IAAF World Cup in 1981 and he became the world 5000 metres champion at the 1983 World Championships in Athletics.

After competitive retirement, he continued to race and became the first man over 40 years old to run a sub-four-minute mile. He has appeared as a panellist on Irish broadcaster RTÉ and released his autobiography, Chairman of the Boards, Master of the Mile, in 2008.

In May 2011, Coghlan was appointed as a Senator by the Taoiseach Enda Kenny.

Early life

Coghlan was born in Drimnagh, Dublin, Republic of Ireland, and educated at St. Vincent's C.B.S., Glasnevin. He lived in Rye, New York for a number of years in the 1980s before returning to live in Ireland. He was a childhood friend of Brian Kerr, who went on to manage the Irish national football team.

Coghlan's first running club was the Celtic Athletic Club. On its break-up he moved to the Metropolitan Harriers and was coached by Gerry Farnan. he won the Leinster colleges cross country championships & the 5000m track title in 1970. The following year he won the All-Ireland 1500 metres and 5000 metres titles. In 1971 he was offered a scholarship by Villanova University. The famous running coach James 'Jumbo' Elliott invited Coghlan to train for the Villanova track and field team. While there he won four NCAA individual titles over 1500 meters and the mile. On 10 May 1975 Coghlan ran his first sub 4-minute mile in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (3:56.2). One week later, on 17 May, he broke the long-standing European Outdoor Mile record of Michel Jazy, in a time of 3:53.3 in Kingston, Jamaica. He graduated from Villanova University, Pennsylvania, USA in 1976 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Marketing and Communications.

Personal life

He and his wife, Yvonne, have four children. His youngest son, John, is one of Ireland's leading athletes who won a team gold medal in the European Cross Country Championships in Portugal in 2010. His eldest son, Eamonn, is a golf professional in Royal Oaks Golf and Country Club, Houston, Texas. While Michael appeared on TV3's Total Xposure and is an aspiring actor. His eldest child, Suzanne, has a career in banking and lives in Dublin.

Indoor career

Coghlan was nicknamed "The Chairman of the Boards" because of his success on indoor tracks. He won 52 of his 70 races at 1500 m and 1 Mile from 1974 to 1987. He set the world record for the indoor mile run with a time of 3.52.6 at the San Diego Sports Arena in San Diego in 1979. He lowered this to 3:50.6 in 1981 and then bettered it to 3:49.78 in 1983 at New Jersey's Meadowlands Arena indoor arena. His record stood until 1997 when it was broken by Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj in a time of 3:48.45. It is still the second fastest indoor mile of all time and is still, more than 30 years on, a European record. Coghlan's 1983 time was the fastest mile ever run in the United States until 10 June 2007, when Daniel Kipchirchir Komen ran 3:48.28 outdoors in Eugene, Oregon. It remains one of only four sub-3:50 miles run on American soil. By and large, Coghlan was more successful at indoor running notwithstanding a later world title in 1983 over 5000 meters.

Coghlan also set the record for the indoor 2000 meter run at 4:54.07 in 1987 which stood until Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia ran 4:52.86 in 1998 (which was broken in 2007 when Kenenisa Bekele of Ethiopia ran 4:49.99). Coghlan won the world famous Wanamaker Mile at the Millrose Games in NYC's Madison Square Garden a record seven times (1977, 1979-81, 1983, 1985, 1987) his last win being at the age of 34. His record stood for over twenty years with Bernard Lagat winning for an eighth time in 2010: Coghlan fired the starting pistol to the record-breaking race and presented Lagat with a trophy.

Outdoor career

He won the 5000 metres at the 1983 World Championships to follow two fourth places in the Olympics (in the 1500 meters in 1976 and the 5000 meters in 1980).

In the 1976 Olympics, he probably made a mistake by taking the lead at 500 metres and by not accelerating enough before the winner, John Walker, passed him at 1200 metres. Thus he lost valuable energy which he would have needed in the home straight's struggle against Walker, Belgium's Ivo van Damme and West Germany's Paul-Heinz Wellman. In the 1980 Olympics 5,000 metres he probably made a mistake by sprinting to the lead at the start of the last back straight.

In any case, he led the race for only a few seconds before Ethiopia's Miruts Yifter kicked past him on the inside. By contrast, in the 1983 World Championships in Athletics 5000 metres, Coghlan was in peak shape and ran intelligently, catching the Soviet Union's Dmitry Dmitriyev on the last back straight and sprinting past him with about 120 metres to go. He ran the last 1000 metres very fast, in 2:24.77, and won the race by 1.67 seconds, despite clearly slowing down in the final metres. He also won silver at the 1978 European Championships in Prague over 1500 m, behind Steve Ovett of Great Britain, and in 1979, he competed in his only European Indoor Championships (he raced sparingly on the European indoor circuit due to his indoor commitments in the US), taking the gold medal in the 1500 m in Vienna. In December 1979 he ran the only sub 50-minute time in the Waterhouse Byrne Baird Shield 10 Mile Cross Country. He missed out on the 1982 European Championships and the 1984 Olympic Games due to injury. He won the IAAF World Cup in 1981 over 5000 m. Coghlan was eliminated in the 5,000-metre semi-finals at the 1988 Seoul Olympics

In total, Coghlan ran 83 sub 4-minute miles, indoor and out.

Life after retirement

In 1994, on the Harvard University indoor track, Eamonn became the first man over age 40 to run a sub-four-minute mile. He was 41 at the time. Coghlan ran the sub-four-minute mile as a "Special Attraction" during the middle of the Massachusetts State High School Championship meet. Athletes surrounded the banked track clapping and pounding out the rhythm of :59 sec. splits on the fast Harvard track.

Coghlan works as director of fundraising (North America) for the Children's Medical & Research Foundation, Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Dublin and is a regular panellist on Ireland's television station RTÉ for athletics programs. He coaches a number of Irish international runners including David Campbell, David Fitzmaurice and his son John.

In 2002, he appeared in part two of the original Mrs Browns Boys series.

In 2008, he served as Grand Marshal for Dublin's St Patrick's Day parade.

Coghlan's book Chairman of the Boards, Master of the Mile was released in 2008.

Political career

In May 2011, he was appointed as a Senator by the Taoiseach Enda Kenny. He sat as an independent until 7 February 2012, when he joined the Fine Gael party. He ran as the Fine Gael candidate in the 2014 Dublin West by-election.

During an election debate on Tonight with Vincent Browne, he baffled viewers and panel members by telling a bizarre anecdote, including an impersonation, about a constituent he had met during his canvass. His campaign largely "fell flat on its face" according to a Fine Gael minister, despite the party putting significant resources into the constituency

He polled 3,788 first preference votes, placing fifth in the contest and being eliminated on the fourth count. This was a 1.9% drop in the Fine Gael vote, compared to the previous by-election result in the same constituency.
