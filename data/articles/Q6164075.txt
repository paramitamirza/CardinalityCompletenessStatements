General Vito Alessio Robles (August 14, 1879June 11, 1957) was a Mexican military officer, engineer, writer, journalist, diplomat, and academic who participated in the Mexican Revolution. He was one of the country's leading historians, as well as a politician, serving as a senator and opposition party leader. His work on the history of Coahuila y Tejas, in three volumes, is notable. He was temperamentally a public prosecutor and as a critic he spoke and wrote with total frankness. He is credited as the first generation of romantic revolutionaries of Mexico who dreamed and put to action the civic movement which would ensure better opportunities open to the people of Mexico.

Early years

He was born in 1879 in Saltillo, Coahuila, (baptized 30 August 1879 - San Esteban protomártir), the eldest of the seven sons of Dominic Alessio Bello, a merchant from Salerno, Italy, and Crisanta Robles Rivas.

He studied at the Ateneo Fuente. In 1896, he entered the Heroic Military Academy where he pursued a career in engineering, graduating in December 1903 as a lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers and served the same institution as a professor, and served the army with total loyalty. His campaign as an army officer covered México city, Jalapa, Monterrey and Sonora. He met his future wife, Espinosa Como Cuevas Trinidad at the Río Yaqui, Sonora. In the fight against Madero in Chihuahua, he was injured at Malpaso. He married Cuevas Espinosa in 1906, and they had four children, of whom Angela Alessio Robles and Cuevas are known.
