He started his political career as assistant to the Amsterdam Alderman Jan Schaefer. Between 1990 and 1998 he was member of the Amsterdam municipal council, from 1993 as the chair of the Labour Party group. After leaving politics he became a full-time lawyer. 

National Politics

In the local elections, politicians were criticized by Van der Laan for distributing election leaflets in minority languages and in some cases leaflets were collected. Due to this anti-Multicultural stand in a multicultural city, van der Laan has been accused of hypocrisy by his own Labour Party party's main candidate.

In 2006 he was informateur in the negotiations of the new Amsterdam Executive Board. On 23 June 2010 he was nominated by the Amsterdam municipal council to become Mayor of Amsterdam. This nomination is subject to Royal assent.
