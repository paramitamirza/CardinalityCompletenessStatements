Kathryn Beaumont (born 27 June 1938) is an English actress, voice actress, singer, and school teacher who was born in London. She is best known for providing the voices of both Alice in Disney's Alice in Wonderland and Wendy in Disney's Peter Pan. Walt Disney personally cast Beaumont after seeing the film On an Island with You, in which child actress Beaumont had a small role. Beaumont has also reprised her voice acting role as Alice in two episodes of the animated series, Disney's House of Mouse, and as both Alice and Wendy in the video game Kingdom Hearts.

In 2005, Beaumont retired as the voice of Alice and Wendy, and her role as these two characters was taken over by Hynden Walch.
