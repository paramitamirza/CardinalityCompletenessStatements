Television

Bradbury's first ever television show was a cable show called Tellywest, where he worked alongside Sacha Baron Cohen. He has also hosted shows on Bravo including Mercenaries in 2001/2002 (later repeated on the Virgin Channel some years later), and also on Trouble TV including T Spot, Trouble @ Breakfast, Jason On Your Doorstop and Trouble Radio.

The Gadget Show

On The Gadget Show, Bradbury regularly visits universities, laboratories and research and development departments to see future science and technology. He is known for his exotic DIY gadget builds, which have included a DIY hoverboard, the world's first 'phone glove', a Head-Up Display for his girlfriend's car, and a "mind-reading" device made from a modified mouse that (crudely) controlled a computer. He also built his own hovercraft using only a car wheel and an industrial sized fan. On one of the gadget show episodes Suzi Perry tries to rid him of his "addiction" to Apple products but fails when it comes to his Macbook.

Don't Scare the Hare

Jason was the host of the primetime BBC One game show Don't Scare the Hare which made its debut on 23 April 2011. The show was presented by Jason and narrated by Sue Perkins, however the programme was scheduled to run for 9 episodes (including a compilation show) but it was axed after just a few episodes due to poor ratings. 

Motor Morphers

Jason hosts the Channel 5 show Motor Morphers which made its debut on 6 May 2013. In it, two teams are tasked with converting an old vehicle each into something completely different, which they then pit against each other to see whose is best. The programme aired for 4 episodes.
