Early life

Born in Canberra, Piper studied arts (majoring in political science) at the Australian National University. During his studies, he was an accomplished street performer, and together with friends Richard Fidler and Tim Ferguson, formed a comedy busking trio called the Doug Anthony All Stars. In 1985, Piper left the All Stars to study acting at the Cours Florent in Paris, and was replaced by Paul McDermott.

United Nations career

Piper began his career in humanitarian development in 1989, joining the Australian government aid agency AusAID. In 1990, he joined the United Nations, working with the United Nations Population Fund in Thailand, then the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Cambodia and Fiji. He served in several key roles at UNDP, and from 2002 was Development Coordinator and Resident Representative in Kosovo.

In 2005, in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, Piper was asked by former US President Bill Clinton to serve as his chief of staff, in Clinton's capacity as UN Special Envoy for Tsunami Recovery.

From 2008 to 2013, Piper was Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Nepal. In March 2013, he was appointed Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for the Sahel, supporting humanitarian work across the nine countries of the region (Senegal, The Gambia, Chad, Burkina Faso, Niger, Mauritania, Northern Nigeria, Northern Cameroon and Mali).
