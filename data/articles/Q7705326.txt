Terunobu Maeda (Maeda Terunobu), born January 2, 1945, is the president and chief executive officer of Mizuho Financial Group (2002-), and a former chairman of the Japanese Bankers Association (2005-2006). 

Maeda was born in Kumamoto, raised in Nakatsu, ÅŒita and graduated from the University of Tokyo with a degree in law.

Maeda joined Fuji Bank in 1968. He became vice-president of Fuji Bank, the predecessor of the present Mizuho Financial Group, in 1999. The bank recorded a loss of 2.38 trillion JPY that fiscal year as it wrote off non-performing loans accrued during three recessions in a decade. Maeda returned it to profitability the next year after reducing bad assets and through gains on investments in Japanese stocks.

Maeda was named "Top Chief Executive Officer" in Japanese banking sector in 2007, according to Institutional Investor magazine.
