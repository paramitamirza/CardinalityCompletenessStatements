Michael Muhney (born June 12, 1975) is an American actor. Muhney is best known for his role as Sheriff Don Lamb on Veronica Mars, as well as his role as Adam Newman on The Young and the Restless. He is the second adult actor to portray Adam, debuting in the role on June 25, 2009, after Chris Engen left the show. On December 17, 2013, Muhney announced via his official Twitter account that he had been fired from the series. His final episode was aired on January 30, 2014.

Early life

Muhney was born in Chicago and raised in Euless, Texas from the age of eight. When he was 16 years old, he won the state championship for his One-Act play performance while attending Trinity High School. He moved back to Chicago where he earned a bachelor's degree from The Theatre School at DePaul University in 1997. He is a member of Mensa. He also speaks two other languages, German and American Sign Language (ASL).

Controversy

In 2013, celebrity news website TMZ reported that Muhney's dismissal was the result of sexual harassment accusations by Young & The Restless co-star Hunter King. TMZ reported that Hunter complained that Muhney fondled her breasts on two occasions, both of which she protested were unsolicited and unwanted advances. Allegedly, King told producers she would go to the police and file a report against Muhney for allegedly groping her if he wasnâ€™t fired from the show. Muhney was fired from the show December 17, 2013. However, CBS, Sony Pictures and Ms. King have neither confirmed nor denied these allegations publicly. On August 13, 2014, Muhney claimed on his Twitter page that the allegations were indeed false and it was only a salacious rumor.
