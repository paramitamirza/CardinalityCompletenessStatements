His family moved from Chicago to a farm near Quakertown, Pennsylvania, and then to Philadelphia, where his father opened a grocery store. He later earned a degree in business administration by attending the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in the evenings.

One of his early jobs was as a salesman for Campbell Soup. He hit upon the idea of selling frozen fish in 1946 when he was on strike from his job at the General Electric plant in Philadelphia.

The company suffered after Piszek bought Arthur Treacher's Fish and Chips in 1979. He sold the business to the Campbell Soup Company in 1982 for close to $70 million.

He wrote a book, "Some Good in the World: A Life of Purpose".
