Career

Television

Ross became a researcher at London Weekend Television before becoming an editor for The Six O'Clock Show and The London Programme. He worked as the series editor on series 3 and 4 of Channel 4's magazine style programme The Word, and became executive producer for series 5.

His first job as a TV presenter was on the current affairs show Eyewitness, which ran for two years and saw him filming in Sicily, the United States, Brazil and Russia. He also fronted the police appeals show Crime Monthly for ITV.

His onscreen break came in 1993 with Channel 4's The Big Breakfast, on which Ross worked first as a reporter and then as a studio presenter. Celebrities Ross has interviewed include Mike Tyson, Sandra Bullock and Arnold Schwarzenegger.

In 1995, Ross was chosen as the presenter of the game show Jeopardy!, which had been recently taken over by Sky One. The year was one of Ross' busiest and he was seen presenting (as well as episodes of The Big Breakfast), the ITV series Big City and Good Sex Guide Aboard.

In April 1996, he presented a celebrity based television show called The Very Famous Paul Ross Show for The Family Channel, in which he interviewed performers Adam West, Lynne Perrie and Cannon and Ball. In September of the same year, he teamed up with Sarah Greene and the pair launched a Sky One afternoon chat show called 1 to 3, aimed primarily at women with a mix of movies, music, celebrities, topical information, lifestyle and entertainment.

In January 1997, Ross presented the first episode of All Over the Shop, his celebrity based panel game show based on consumer issues. The programme, broadcast on BBC1 proved popular, running for three series until July 1999, by which time 85 episodes had been made. A critic on Gameshow.com gave All Over the Shop positive remarks by saying: "For an early morning slot, this was quite a perky little show, a fact that must have been recognised due to its spin-off programmes."   That same year Ross fronted Endurance UK, the UK's equivalent of the cult Japanese show Za Gaman for the Challenge TV channel, and it was commissioned for a second series the following year. Ross also found the time to present yet another game show, Tellystack for UK Gold.

In 2000, he presented a television game show for Living TV called Mystic Challenge.

In October 2001, Ross appeared as a guest on BBC Two's popular comedy panel show Never Mind the Buzzcocks. The following month he returned to his now familiar role as presenter with No Win, No Fee, a new game show for BBC One. The show would become one of Ross' biggest successes, it was broadcast from 29 October 2001 to 29 August 2003, with three series and 70 episodes made.

In an interview with the Daily Record newspaper in 1996 he joked: "I'm a bighead and I was in telly before Jonathan - behind the cameras - and what I do is very different. "Unlike Jonathan's shows where people tune in specifically to see him, with me they tune in to see me host a show where the stars are whoever else is on it."

On 31 August 2014, Ross told The Sun on Sunday that he had developed an addiction to mephedrone over the previous year and had an affair with another man. His wife is standing by him.

On his brother's chat show, well known anarchist Ian Bone said that Paul Ross had "grassed up the poll-tax rioters" on "Crime Monthly" on television following the major poll-tax protest.
