Donna D'Errico (born March 30, 1968) is an American actress and model who posed for Playboy Magazine as its Playmate of the Month for September 1995, and had a starring role (1996-1998) on the television series Baywatch. She continues to act in films and on television.

Career

Before appearing in Playboy, D'Errico had a Las Vegas based limousine company. When Playboy chose her as its Playmate of the Month for September 1995, her centerfold was photographed by Richard Fegley.

D'Errico was chosen for a starring role on the television series Baywatch, as Donna Marco for two seasons, from 1996 to 1998. One installment of the program dealt with her Playboy layout. She was also a host of the show Battlebots and starred in Candyman: Day of the Dead. For a time, D'Errico owned Zen Spa, a day spa in Calabasas, California. After leaving Baywatch, she appeared in independent films, including Intervention, Inconceivable, and The Making of Plus One.

Personal life

D'Errico divorced rock musician Nikki Sixx in 2007, after nine years of marriage. They had separated shortly after their daughter Frankie Jean's birth in , and reconciled months later when Sixx completed rehabilitation for chemical dependence. The two separated again on April 27, 2006, and divorced June 2007. D'Errico had been in another relationship, from which her son, Rhyan, had been born in 1993.

D'Errico subsequently describes herself as a devout Roman Catholic who attends Mass weekly and prays the Rosary every night with her children. When asked how her renewed Catholic faith related to her past, she said, "I’ve made mistakes and choices in my past that I wouldn’t make today. That's a chapter in my life that I’ve closed the door on. It's like that's another person. It's not who I am today."

Mount Ararat expedition

In 2011, D'Errico said she was in training to fulfill a long-held dream of climbing Mount Ararat in Turkey in search of the frozen remains of Noah's ark. In the same interview she said she was preparing to start a cooking show, also described as a lifelong dream. D'Errico climbed Mount Ararat in the summer of 2012, returning home to the U.S. in August, having suffered a "major fall" near the end of the hike. She later produced a documentary about her Mount Ararat expedition.

Bankruptcy

On February 11, 2014, D'Errico filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. In court documents, consisting of paperwork she filed in the Central District of California, D'Errico cited total assets of $413,574.74, including no more than $20 cash on hand, and total liabilities of $947,332.22. She listed her mean-average income per month at $7,858.33, but cited monthly expenses that came to $10,991.04. One of her checking accounts was completely emptied, and she was overdrawn on another account. Among her assets was the support she received from Sixx, which amounted to $7,800 per month, in addition to 5.0% of all Sixx's annual earnings; Radar Online, from which these figures were obtained, cited that figure as exceeding $2.1 million per year. D’Errico listed her percentage of it as being worth an approximation of $400,000. The paperwork blamed D’Errico's “acrimonious divorce from and resulting custody battle” with Sixx, due to her having to hire lawyers, for her financial difficulties. She listed almost $600,000 in legal debt and more than $20,000 in credit card debt, which was subsequently discharged.

To finance her Mount Ararat documentary, D'Errico employed crowdfunding, using Kickstarter with a goal of $10,000 and ended up raising $11,000.
