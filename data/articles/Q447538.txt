Susanna Rahkamo (born 25 February 1965) is a Finnish former competitive ice dancer. She competed with Petri Kokko, her future husband. With Kokko, she is the 1995 European champion, 1995 World silver medalist, and competed in the Winter Olympics twice.

Skating career

Rahkamo/Kokko formed their partnership in 1985 and moved to Oberstdorf, Germany to train with Martin Skotnický. Their first major international event was the 1986 European Championships, where they finished 18th. In 1990, they reached the top ten at the European and World Championships for the first time.

In the 1991-92 season, Rahkamo/Kokko won the silver medal at the 1991 Skate America and placed sixth at the 1992 Winter Olympics. The following season, they won gold at the 1992 Skate Canada International and bronze at the 1993 European Championships. They were fourth at the 1993 World Championships.

In 1993-94, Rahkamo/Kokko stood atop the podium at Piruetten. They placed fourth at the 1994 European Championships and at the 1994 Winter Olympics. They ended their season with a bronze medal at the 1994 World Championships. 

At the 1995 European Championships, Rahkamo/Kokko became Finland's first European champions in figure skating — their country's next European title came in 2009 when Laura Lepistö won the ladies' singles event. They went on to win the silver medal at the 1995 World Championships. Their quickstep original dance from the 1994-95 season was adapted into a compulsory dance/pattern dance. It was ratified in June 2008 as the Finnstep. 

Rahkamo/Kokko turned professional in 1995 and performed in ice shows until 2000. They made an appearance on Enigma's music video for Beyond the Invisible.

Rahkamo and Kokko married in 1995 and have two children, Max born in 2001 and Camilla in 2003. Rahkamo has a Master's degree from Helsinki University, Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry. She works as a leadership consultant. Rahkamo was elected president of the Finnish Figure Skating Association in 2004 and vice-president of the Finnish national Olympic committee in November 2012.
