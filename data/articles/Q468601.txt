Career

Stewart began her career as a dancer and moved to London, England to study at age 18. There she landed a role in The Apple, a 1979 low-budget musical science fiction film that has achieved a small cult following in recent years.

After moving to Los Angeles she obtained a role on the soap opera Days of Our Lives, playing the original Kayla Brady from January 1982 to December 1983.
