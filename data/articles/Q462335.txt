Thora Janette Scott (born 14 December 1938) is an English actress. 

Life and career

She was born in Morecambe, Lancashire. She is the daughter of actors Jimmy Scott and Thora Hird. She started her acting career as a child actress known as Janette Scott, and was briefly (along with Jennifer Gay) one of the so-called "Children's Announcers" providing continuity links for the BBC's children's TV programmes from the Lime Grove Studios in the early 1950s. She became a popular leading lady, one of her best-known roles being April Smith in the 1960 film School for Scoundrels, based on the "One-upmanship" books by Stephen Potter, in which Ian Carmichael and Terry-Thomas competed for her attention.

She is best known to American audiences for her role as the parson's wife in the 1959 film, The Devils Disciple, that starred Burt Lancaster, Kirk Douglas, and Laurence Olivier.

Scott wrote her autobiography at the age of 14.
