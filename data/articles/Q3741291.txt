After gaining a master's degree in political history from the University of Helsinki in 1962, Toivanen joined the Finnish section of BBC World Service. One of his tasks there was to produce the music to the radio dramas written by Anselm Hollo and Matti Rossi.

In 1968 he was promoted to newsreader on television and radio, and from 1969 until 1972 he worked as the foreign news editor; in the same year he joined Yle as a news correspondent and broadcaster. His broadcasting career included commentating on four Eurovision Song Contest (1977-1978, 1982 & 1987) and hosting the Finnish coverage of the Summer Olympics on eight occasions between 1972 and 2000.
