The family emigrated when Michael was one year old.

He joined Sinn Féin shortly after the Easter Rising and was responsible for defending a number of Irish Republican Army prisoners including Sean MacEoin and Thomas Whelan. In the 1917 Clare East by-election he was a prominent worker for Éamon de Valera, and in the 1918 general election he was the election agent for Constance Markievicz and Seán T. O'Kelly. During the Irish War of Independence Noyk was a high-level official and adviser with the Department of Finance which was then headed by Michael Collins. Noyk also participated in Dáil Courts held in Dublin. He was responsible for the procurement of offices at 22 Mary Street in Dublin where the First Dáil's Department of Finance was located during the war.
