A psychiatric nurse and part-time secretary of the Health Services Branch of the SIPTU trade union, Connolly was elected to Dáil Éireann at the 2002 general election as an independent, campaigning primarily around the defence of services of Monaghan general hospital. He joined with other independent TDs to form a Technical group in order to gain speaking rights in the Dáil. He lost his seat at the 2007 general election. After his defeat he stood for election to Seanad Éireann on the Labour Panel, but was not elected. He was elected to Monaghan County Council at the 2009 local elections and re-elected in 2014.
