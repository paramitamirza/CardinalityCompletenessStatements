Legal/business career

U.S. House of Representatives

Elections

	2004

Canseco ran for the newly redrawn Texas' 28th congressional district. In the Republican primary, he and attorney Jim Hopson qualified for a run-off election. Canseco got just 21% of the vote, while Hopson got 49% of the vote (barely missing the 50% threshold to win the primary). In the run-off election, Hopson defeated Canseco 65%-35%.

	2008

Canseco was defeated in the Republican primary by Bexar County Commissioner and former San Antonio city councilman Lyle Larson 62%-38%.

	2010

In the Republican primary, Canseco and CIA officer Will Hurd qualified for a run-off election; Hurd got 34%, while Canseco got 32%. In the run-off, Canseco defeated Hurd 53%-47%.

In the general election, Canseco faced incumbent Democratic congressman Ciro Rodriguez. The Republican National Committee gave strong financial support to Canseco in an effort to regain the seat for the Republicans. As of October 13, 2010, Rodriguez had raised more cash overall ($1,481,520 versus Canseco's $980,821), but Canseco had more cash on hand ($147,961 versus Rodriguez's $90,915).

Canseco defeated Rodriguez 49%-44%.

	2012

Ciro Rodriguez filed for a rematch with Canseco in 2012, but he lost the Democratic primary to State Representative Pete Gallego, 55%-45%.

In the November 6 general election, Gallego defeated Canseco 50%-46%. Two minor candidates held the remaining 4.1% of the ballots. The race was contested amid allegations of voter fraud and irregularities. On November 9, Canseco conceded to Gallego, citing the high costs and lengthy period of time required to contest the election. Although Canseco continued to allege numerous irregularities, he had concluded that "a full investigation and recount would be expensive and time-consuming," considering that the 23rd District embraces all or parts of 29 counties.  Canseco carried the district's portion of Bexar County, home to more than half the district's population. However, it was not enough to overcome Gallego's margins in the central and western portions of the district, which were virtually coextensive with Gallego's old state House district. Gallego also dominated the heavily Hispanic border areas.

	2014

In a bid to return to Congress, Canseco polled 10,204 votes (40.4%) in the Republican primary on March 4. He finished a close second to Will Hurd, his intraparty rival from 2010. Hurd, an African American, received 10,348 votes (49.9%). The remaining but 4,723 votes (18.7%) went to a third candidate, Robert Lowry. In the May 27 runoff Hurd handily defeated Canseco, 8,698 (59.5%) to 5,924 (40.5%). Hurd now faces freshman Democratic Representative Pete Gallego in the November 4 general election.

When Canseco ran for Congress in 2010, he obtained two loans totaling $88,000 from his family-owned enterprises. The money was taken from a bank account of a subsidiary company with an address in Mexico. He also provided $86,000 in his own funds as a campaign loan. As Canseco runs in 2014, federal regulators are auditing his campaign funds to see if they are in violation of restrictions on corporate contributions and a longstanding ban on political donations made by foreign nationals, corporations, partnerships, and associations.

Tenure

Canseco describes himself as a "limited-government conservative."

He supports the Arizona immigration law. He supports the extension of the Bush tax cuts and repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. During the campaign, Canseco openly identified with the Tea Party movement.

Canseco was a member of the Republican Study Committee, a caucus of conservative House Republicans. During his tenure, he was one of four voting Latino members of Congress known to be a member of the RSC, the others being Bill Flores of Texas, Raul Labrador of Idaho and Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington. He was also a member of the Congressional Hispanic Conference. In 2012, Canseco delivered the Spanish language version of the Republican response to the State of the Union address.

In summer 2011, Canseco was criticized after initially declining to introduce a bill allowing for a swap of land between the Federal Government and Bexar County, Texas. The bill, which was supported by United States Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and sponsored by retiring Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison in the Senate, would expand the development of the San Antonio River to the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park.

In October 2011, Canseco introduced the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park Boundary Expansion Act in the House, which mirrored Hutchison's Senate bill. The legislation would cost roughly $4 million over four years, even though the lands would be donated.

In April 2012, Canseco traveled using the San Antonio International Airport. He said that he was assaulted by the Transportation Security Administration when an officer "was patting me down where no one is supposed to go." The TSA officer said that he was assaulted by Canseco, but no arrests were made. Canseco advocates for changes in security procedures.

Canseco reportedly voted with his party 96% of the time on all issues.
