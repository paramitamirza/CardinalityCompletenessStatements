Life and career

Sigmundur Davíð holds a Bachelor's degree in business administration from the University of Iceland.

He was elected chairman of the Progressive Party on 18 January 2009 with 40.9% of the votes of party members, beating Höskuldur Þórhallsson (37.9%).

On 22 January 2009, Sigmundur Davíð proposed the support of the Progressive Party's seven votes in the Althing for a minority coalition between the Social Democratic Alliance and the Left-Green Movement, as an alternative to the ruling coalition between the Independence Party and the Social Democratic Alliance and with the aim of forcing early elections. The next day, Prime Minister Geir Haarde announced elections for 9 May 2009, in which for health reasons he would not be a candidate.

In the Althing election on 27 April 2013, the Progressive Party and Independence Party each won 19 seats. On 30 April President Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson asked Sigmundur Davíð to form a government.

On 17 May 2013 Icelandic media reported that Sigmundur Davíð, as chairman of the Progressive Party, would become Iceland’s next prime minister while the leader of the Independence Party, Bjarni Benediktsson, would take up the position of Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs. He is the youngest prime minister in the history of the Icelandic Republic and was the world's youngest democratically elected head of government at that time.
