Gibbs is best known for her role as Louise and George Jefferson's feisty maid, Florence Johnston, in the long-running CBS sitcom, The Jeffersons (1975-85), for which she received nominations for five Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. She also starred in the show's spin-off Checking In (1981). From 1985 to 1990, Gibbs had the leading role as Mary Jenkins in the NBC sitcom, 227, which she also co-produced and sang on the theme song. Gibbs has won a total of seven NAACP Image Awards.

In later years, Gibbs played supporting roles in films The Meteor Man (1993), Lost & Found (1999), The Visit (2000), The Brothers (2001), and Madea's Witness Protection (2012).

Early life

Gibbs was born Margaret Theresa Bradley on June 14, 1931, in Chicago, Illinois to Ophelia Birdie (née Kemp) and Douglas Bradley. She attended Wendell Phillips Academy High School in the Bronzeville neighborhood on Chicago's south side graduating in 1949. Shortly after high school, Gibbs moved to Detroit, Michigan where she attended Peters Business School. She worked as a reservations agent for United Airlines before relocating with her children from Detroit to Los Angeles.

Career

Gibbs got her first acting job in the early 1970s, in the blaxploitation films Sweet Jesus, Preacher Man and Black Belt Jones. In 1975 she was cast as Florence Johnston, the family's sassy, backtalking, wisecracking maid, in the CBS comedy series, The Jeffersons. The show is one of the longest-running sitcoms in the history of American television. For her performance on the series, Gibbs was nominated for an Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series five times, and once for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress - Series, Miniseries or Television Film. In 1981 she starred in the short-lived spin-off of The Jeffersons, called Checking In.

Gibbs responded in a 2015 interview on Broadway Showbiz, when asked if she'd portrayed any of the characters that she played in real-life;"Yes, Florence was like my aunt and grandmother so I lived it. She came easy to me so I'm like Florence in giving smart answers, but I was also shy so I wouldn't have dared to say some of the things Florence said. I prefer to do whatever I can do at the moment. Whoever's hiring me at the moment...that's what I'm supposed to do. My favorite is Drama. I'm doing that now (on Scandal), but also still doing Comedy on Hot in Cleveland."

In 1985, when The Jeffersons was cancelled after 11 seasons, Gibbs began starring as the lead actress in the NBC sitcom, 227. The series aired until 1990, producing more that 100 episodes. About two decades later, Gibbs teamed up again with former 227 co-star and long-time friend, Jackée Harry, to star together in The First Family, where Gibbs had a recurring role as Harry's on-screen mother, Grandma Eddy. Then, she again worked with Harry, in another independent film, Forbidden Woman. 

Gibbs had a number of supporting film roles, and guest starred on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Touched by an Angel, Judging Amy, ER, and Southland. From 1998 to 2002 she had a recurring role on The Hughleys. In 2012, Gibbs appeared in the Tyler Perry film Madea's Witness Protection, and in 2014 starred in the independent film, Grantham & Rose. In 2015, she had cameo appearance in the episode of Shonda Rhimes' drama series, Scandal.

Gibbs owned a jazz club in South Central L.A. called "Marla's Memory Lane Jazz and Supper Club" from 1981 to 1999. As singer, she released number of music albums.

Personal life

She was married to her high school sweetheart Jordan Gibbs from 1955 to 1973; the couple had three children: Angela Gibbs, Dorian Gibbs and Joseph Gibbs. Her older sister is the late actress Susie Garrett. Her daughter Angela Gibbs is also an actress who appeared in movies such as Together Brothers, Drumline and Think Like A Man Too.

On June 14, 2011, she celebrated her 80th birthday.

On July 31, 2014, Gibbs attended the Leimert Park Village Book Fair in Los Angeles, California, to pay tribute to both of her longtime friends, Maya Angelou, who died on May 28, and Ruby Dee, 2 weeks later, on June 11, and 3 days, before Marla's 83rd Birthday.
