Liam J. McLaughlin (born January 16, 1968) is the Council President of the Yonkers City Council. He is a practicing attorney and partner at McLaughlin & Zerafa, LLP, an estates and trusts firm.

Early career and background

McLaughlin grew up in Yonkers, New York and attended Fordham University where he received a Bachelor's degree in accounting in 1989. He became an auditor at Ernst and Young and went on to receive a Juris Doctorate from New York Law School in 1996.

Political career

Involved with a local neighborhood association, as well as the Ancient Order of Hibernians, McLaughlin first ran for the City Council in Yonkers, New York's fourth largest city and one of the "Big Five" cities in the State, in a 1997 election for the fourth district council seat. He scored an impressive 38% of the vote as a third-party candidate on the Conservative Party of New York State line. He won the seat outright during the 1999 general election after winning the Republican primary and served from 2000 to 2010, including service as Minority Leader and Majority Leader.

He ran for the New York State Senate in 2010 after being term-limited off the Council against State Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, garnering a surprising 45% of the vote in a heavily gerrymandered Democratic district. He then returned to private law practice and served as an adjunct professor at Manhattan College.

In 2013, he was elected Council President. His first local law gave a school tax exemption to military veterans, which made Yonkers the first major city in New York to offer that benefit to service members.
