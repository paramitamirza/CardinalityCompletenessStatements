Scott Milne Matheson (January 8, 1929  -  October 7, 1990), was the 12th Governor of Utah from 1977 to 1985. He is currently the last Democrat to serve in that position.

Matheson was born on January 8, 1929 in Chicago to Latter-day Saint parents Scott Milne and Adele Adams Matheson. Soon after his birth, the family moved to Utah, settling first in Parowan, before moving to Salt Lake City, when his father became a federal prosecutor.

Matheson graduated from Salt Lake City's East High School in 1946, earned a bachelor's degree in political science from the University of Utah in 1950, and a law degree from Stanford University in 1952. He operated a private law practice in Iron County, Utah for five years before taking a position with Union Pacific Railroad in 1958. At the railroad he rose to the position of general counsel before making his 1976 run for governor.

During his term as governor, Matheson was named defendant in the U.S. Supreme Court case of H. L. v. Matheson.

On 25 August 1951 he married Norma Louise Warenski, and the couple had four children. One is former U.S. Congressman Jim Matheson. Another son, Scott Matheson, Jr., was the 2004 Democratic nominee for Governor of Utah, and is currently a federal Judge. 

On 7 October 1990 Governor Matheson died of multiple myeloma, a rare form of cancer, and was buried in Parowan City Cemetery in Parowan, Utah.
