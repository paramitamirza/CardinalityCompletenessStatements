Kim Wyman (born July 15, 1962) is the current Secretary of State of Washington, having won in the 2012 state elections. She is currently the only member of the Republican Party elected to statewide office on the West Coast of the United States.

Early life

Wyman attended college at California State University, Long Beach and lived abroad after graduation. Barriers to voting in US elections while living in Germany inspired her to become an elections official. She earned her Master of Public Administration degree from Troy State University's European Division. Wyman was one of the first public officials to become a Certified Elections/Registration Administrator from Auburn University.

Career

In 2001, Wyman was appointed as county auditor for Thurston County, succeeding Sam Reedâ€”she would again succeed Reed following her election as Secretary of State of Washington. She was eventually elected to the position and later reelected, as recently as 2010.

In the 2012 Washington state elections, Wyman was elected Secretary of State, defeating her Democratic opponent, Kathleen Drew. Wyman was the only Republican elected to statewide office in the state. She was endorsed in the election by the Walla Walla Union-Bulletin, The Wenatchee World, the Tri-City Herald, and The Seattle Times. The Times cited her bipartisan appeal and experience as an elections administrator in its endorsement. She was also endorsed by the Washington Education Association, which normally endorses Democrats.

Personal life

Wyman lives in Lacey, Washington with her husband John and their two children. She has run several marathons.
