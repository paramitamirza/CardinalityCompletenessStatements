Biography

Jhunjhnuwala was born in Hong Kong in 1963. In 1984, he graduated from the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California.

Jhunjhnuwala began his career managing his family’s OEM watch business under the Hind Group in Hong Kong. In 2002, he sold the business and ventured into property development after acquiring an office complex in Hong Kong’s Central business district. Girish decided to develop this building into the first Ovolo serviced apartment. After proving the concept, Jhunjhnuwala acquired more properties and continued expanding the Ovolo Hotels brand.

In 2011, Ovolo transitioned its business away from serviced apartments into hotels. In fall 2012, Ovolo opened its first overseas hotel in Melbourne, Australia and has since acquired a further three properties in the country. The Group now plans to expand further in Australia in the coming years.
