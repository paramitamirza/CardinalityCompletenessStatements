            "The major development taking place in Bach's time, and to which he contributed in no small way, was the development of a temperament for keyboard instruments that allowed to use these in all available keys (12 major and 12 minor), and which allowed modulating without retuning.",
            "Already his Capriccio on the departure of a beloved brother, a very early work, showed a gusto for modulation incomparable to any contemporary work this composition has been compared to, but the full expansion came with The Well-Tempered Clavier, using all keys, which Bach seems to have been developing from around 1720, with the Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach as one of its earliest witnesses.",

            "Bach wrote for the organ, and for the other keyboard instruments of his day, mainly the harpsichord, but also the clavichord, and his personal favourite: the lute-harpsichord (the compositions listed as works for the lute, BWV 995-1000 and 1006a were probably written for this instrument).",
            "During his most productive period (1708-14) he composed about a dozen pairs of preludes and fugues, five toccatas and fugues, and the Little Organ Book, an unfinished collection of forty-six short chorale preludes that demonstrates compositional techniques in the setting of chorale tunes.",
            "After leaving Weimar, Bach wrote less for organ, although some of his best-known works (the six trio sonatas, the German Organ Mass in  from 1739, and the Great Eighteen chorales, revised late in his life) were composed after his leaving Weimar.",
            "The larger works are usually intended for a harpsichord with two manuals, while performing them on a keyboard instrument with a single manual (like a piano) may provide technical difficulties for the crossing of hands.",

            "Many of his solo works, such as his six sonatas and partitas for violin (BWV 1001-1006) and his six cello suites (BWV 1007-1012) are widely considered among the most profound works in the repertoire.",
            "He wrote sonatas for a solo instrument such as the viola de gamba accompanied by harpsichord or continuo, as well as trio sonatas (two instruments and continuo).",
            "Surviving works in the concerto form include two violin concertos (BWV 1041 in A minor and BWV 1042 in E major) and a concerto for two violins in D minor, BWV 1043, often referred to as Bach's \"double\" concerto.",
            "Bach composed and transcribed concertos for one to four harpsichords.",

            "For other works, Bach's authorship was put in doubt without a generally accepted answer to the question whether or not he composed it: the best known organ composition in the BWV catalogue, the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565 was indicated as one of these uncertain works in the late 20th century.",
            "Soon after the 1829 performance Bach started to become regarded as one of the greatest composers of all times, if not the greatest, a reputation he kept ever since.",
            "Among these were the Swingle Singers' versions of Bach pieces (for instance, the \"\" from Orchestral Suite No. 3, or the  chorale prelude) and Wendy Carlos' 1968 Switched-On Bach, which used the Moog electronic synthesiser.",

            "The Sing-Akademie occasionally performed Bach's works in public concerts, for instance his first keyboard concerto, with one of Itzig's daughters at the piano.",
            "More of Bach's vocal compositions appeared in print: Motets, the E major version of the Magnificat, the Kyrie-Gloria Mass in A major, and the cantate Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott (BWV 80).",
            "When Felix Mendelssohn, Abraham's son, aged 13, produced his first Magnificat setting in 1822 it was clear that he was inspired by the then unpublished D major version of Bach's Magnificat.",
            "Besides these and other public performances and an increased coverage on the composer and his compositions in printed media, the 1830s and 40s also saw the first publication of more vocal works by Bach: six cantatas, the St Matthew Passion and the Mass in B minor.",
            "Chopin started composing his 24 Preludes, Op. 28, inspired by the Well-Tempered Clavier, in 1835 and Schumann published his Sechs Fugen über den Namen B-A-C-H in 1845.",
            "By that time Bach was known as the first of the three Bs in music.",
            "Throughout the 19th century 200 books were published on Bach.",
            "By the end of the century Bach was firmly established as one of the greatest composers, recognized for both his instrumental and his vocal music.",
            "But that was far from the only way Bach's music came to the forefront in the 20th century: his music was heard in versions ranging from Ferruccio Busoni's late romantic piano transcriptions, over jazzy interpretations such as those by the Swingle Singers and orchestrations such as the one opening Walt Disney's Fantasia movie, to synthesiser performances such as Wendy Carlos' Switched-On Bach recordings.",
            "Several 20th century composers referred to Bach or his music, for instance Eugène Ysaÿe in his Six Sonatas for solo violin, Dmitri Shostakovich in his 24 Preludes and Fugues and Heitor Villa-Lobos in his Bachianas Brasileiras.",
            "Around 2000, the 250th anniversary of Bach's death, three record companies issued box sets with complete recordings of Bach's music.",

            "Coming into the nationally televised match on ESPN, played under a heavy downpour with his team down a man and down a goal, even if only 70 percent fit, Beckham left a mark during the remaining twenty plus minutes.",
            "He hit a long free kick that Carlos Pavón failed to finish on for the equaliser, and then in the final minutes Beckham served a weighted through ball into Donovan's path that United's keeper Troy Perkins managed to break up in the last moment - the Galaxy lost 1-0.",
