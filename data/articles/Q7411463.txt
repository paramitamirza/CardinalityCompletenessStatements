Samuel Gardner Wilder (June 20, 1831  -  July 28, 1888) was an American shipping magnate and politician who developed a major transportation company in the Kingdom of Hawaii.

Life

Samuel Gardner Wilder was born June 20, 1831 in Leominster, Massachusetts.His father was William Chauncey Wilder (1804-1858) and mother was Harriet Waters (died 1850). They moved to Canada for a few years, and then to New York in 1840, and Chicago in 1844. Part of the California Gold Rush, the family moved west in 1852. He worked for the Adams Express Company which allowed him to travel to and from the coast of California.His first visit to the Hawaiian Islands was in 1856.He married Elizabeth Kinaʻu Judd (1831-1918), daughter of missionary doctor and politician Gerrit P. Judd September 29, 1857 in Honolulu.She was namesake of the native Hawaiian civil leader Elizabeth Kīnau, who was daughter of Kamehameha I.

Business

Wilder chartered the clipper ship White Swallow and returned in 1858. He took a load of guano (bird excrement used as fertilizer) from Jarvis Island to New York, which served as the couple's honeymoon voyage.He then started a sugar plantation with his father-in-law (now the Kualoa Ranch) in 1864. He sent for his brother, William Chauncey Wilder (1835-1901) who had served in the cavalry in the American Civil War. The plantation failed by 1868 and William returned to Geneva, Illinois.In 1870 other sugar planters had Wilder sent to China to bring back low-cost workers. He encountered resistance from the British administration in Hong Kong, and only 188 Chinese came as a result.

In 1871 he took over the lumber business of James I. Dowsett.He also became agent for the government-owned steamship Kilauea, named for Kīlauea volcano, which ran passenger service between the islands. In 1872 with C. H. Lewers, he established Wilder & Company for the shipping and related businesses.In 1873 his brother William brought out his wife and family to help in the shipping business. After the reciprocity Treaty of 1875, the sugar business boomed, and created demand to use steamships to move the raw sugar to the port of Honolulu where it was taken to the sugar refinery in California owned by Claus Spreckles, who invested in Wilder's company.

In 1877 the government ordered a second steamer Likelike (named for Princess Likelike) from San Francisco. After one voyage, the government promptly sold it to Wilder. The Likelike was about 50% larger than the aged Kilauea, which needed frequent repairs. Part of his agreement was to carry the mail on his ships.

Over time more ships were added to his fleet, and railroads built to meet the ports. The Hawaiian Railroad was constructed from 1881 to 1883.It ran from plantations in the Kohala district of the island of Hawaii to a harbor he built at Māhukona.The company was incorporated as Wilder Steamship Company in 1883.

Politics

In 1868, Wilder was elected to the House of Representatives of the legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom. In 1874, King Lunalilo appointed him to the upper House of Nobles of the legislature. Lunalilo died after reigning only one year, so the first job of the 1874 legislature was to elect a new king; Wilder was selected to count and announce the votes. Wilder used his steamer to campaign for David Kalākaua, who won the election in the Legislative Assembly (and subsequently rewarded Wilder with honors), even though Queen Emma was more popular with the people.In 1878, Wilder established the first telephone line on Oahu, from his government office to his lumber business.

Wilder was awarded the Royal Order of Kalākaua and Royal Order of the Crown of Hawaii.On July 3, 1878, Kalākaua appointed him minister of the interior.He was considered the most powerful member of what was then called the "Wilder Cabinet". Although concerned with efficiency in administration and reducing government debt instead of ideology, one of his projects was to lay the cornerstone of a new royal residence, ʻIolani Palace. On August 14, 1880, the king replaced all his ministers with a controversial and short-lived cabinet headed by Celso Caesar Moreno with John Edward Bush in the interior post.

In 1887, Wilder was elected president of the legislature, although he would leave shortly. In Washington, D.C., he met with diplomat Henry A. P. Carter (who had married Wilder's wife's sister) and US Secretary of State Thomas F. Bayard. Wilder said he supported the monarchy, but was not sure it would last long, and that the US should negotiate for annexation.He traveled to London to raise money for a railroad venture from Hilo to the Hāmākua District of Hawaii island. However, news of the political crisis leading up to the Bayonet Constitution discouraged investors. The new constitution made the upper house elective for the first time, and he won the 1888 election.He died July 28, 1888. He was buried in Oahu Cemetery.
