Pre-1985 NML Annuity Class Action

In a March 6, 2011 court decision against Northwestern Mutual, Reserve Judge Dennis Flynn, of Racine, found testimony of retired Northwestern Mutual CEO Ed Zore "not credible."

"His answer to the conundrums faced by Northwestern Mutual was to tell lies and manufacture reality," Flynn wrote.

The judge determined Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. breached its contracts with thousands of annuity holders when it unilaterally changed how dividends were paid on some annuities sold before 1985, a decision that could expose the company to hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.

In a 97-page decision, Flynn found the company also breached its fiduciary duty and duties of good faith, fair dealing and loyalty during the switch.

"Intentional and repeated concealment of wrongdoing over a period of a quarter century took place," Flynn wrote.
