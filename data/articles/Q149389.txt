Career

1970s

Glória made her debut as an actress at the age of 5, on the telenovela A Pequena Órfã, broadcast on the now defunct TV Excelsior. She initially participated only in the show's opening sequence, but director Dionísio Azevedo would later cast her to play a minor character. On her first day of shooting, however, she experienced a nasal hemorrhage and was removed from the telenovela. Later, when the lead actress Patrícia Ayres dropped out due to contractual reasons, Glória had a second chance by dubbing Ayres' voice.

In 1971, Glória made a screen test for the role of Zizi in the Globo telenovela O Primeiro Amor, but is rejected. In 1972 she made her debut in the network's Caso Especial episode "Sombra de Suspeita". That same year she made her telenovela debut starring in a minor role in Janete Clair's Selva de Pedra. It became the only telenovela in the history of Brazil to reach 100 percent of share. In 1973 Glória landed a tiny role in Clair's O Semideus. She also acted alongside her father and Chico Anysio on the comedy program Chico City, broadcast on Rede Globo. She would act in several other comedy programs. In 1976, Glória starred in Clair's Duas Vidas, where she learned a lot from senior actor Luiz Gustavo, which played her father in the telenovela. In 1977, disappointed with the roles offered to her, she decided to take a break from acting.

In 1978, Glória learned from her father that director Daniel Filho was searching for an actress to play Sônia Braga's teenager daughter in his telenovela Dancin' Days. After much deliberation, she decided to take the screen test for the role. The telenovela was a big hit and Glória won the Best Newcomer Award from the São Paulo Association of Art Critics. During the telenovela's original broadcast, she faced censorship from the Juvenile Court, which prohibited her from giving interviews based on her controversial opinions about the school system. In June 1979 Glória landed the lead role in Cabocla opposite her husband Fábio Júnior. She was unable to shoot the final scenes of the telenovela due to a harsh stress crisis that kept her hospitalized for two weeks.

1980s

In 1980, after she left the hospital, Glória decided to change her visual, cutting and lightening her hair. Her next telenovelas were Água Viva and As Três Marias, an adaptation of Clarice Lispector's novel of the same name. She made a deal with Globo so that she could act in her first feature film after the end of this telenovela. In 1981, Glória starred in Fábio Barreto's Índia, a filha do Sol as Putkoy, a Native Brazilian who falls in love with a white soldier played by Nuno Leal Maia.

In 1984, she acted in the telenovela Partido Alto. The following year would mark Globo's 20th anniversary, and the mini-series O Tempo e o Vento, an adaptation of Érico Veríssimo's novel, would be produced to celebrate it. After she learned of the intentions of Paulo José, the director of the mini-series, to cast her as the main lead Ana Terra, Glória convinced Globo's head director Daniel Filho that she could reconcile the shooting of the telenovela and the mini-series.

After O Tempo e o Vento, Glória starred in her second film, Francisco Ramalho Júnior's Besame Mucho, alongside Antônio Fagundes and José Wilker. She moved to São Paulo for two months with daughter Cléo in order to shot the film. In 1987 she starred in the telenovela Direito de Amar and in the film Jorge, Um Brasileiro.
