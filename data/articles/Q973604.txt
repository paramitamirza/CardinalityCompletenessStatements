Jerry Scott (born May 2, 1955) is an American cartoonist. He is known as the creator of the comic strips Baby Blues and Zits. He is one of only four cartoonists to have multiple popular strips appearing in over 1,000 newspapers worldwide.

Career

Scott started cartooning professionally in the mid-1970s by submitting gag cartoons to magazines, and he sold one from his first batch to the Saturday Evening Post. In 1983, Scott was selected to succeed Mark Lasky (in the wake of Lasky's sudden death) on Ernie Bushmiller's Nancy. Scott modernized the strip to his own specifications, and eventually handed it over to Guy Gilchrist, whose adaptation has been more faithful to Bushmiller's original work, in the 1990s). He became friends with Rick Kirkman and they created Baby Blues, a comic based on family life with little children. Kirkman does the illustrations, while Scott does the writing. Later, Scott and Jim Borgman collaborated to create Zits, which follows family life with a teenaged son. In Zits, Scott does the writing, while the drawings are done by Borgman. As of 2015, Both Baby Blues and Zits are still in syndication.
