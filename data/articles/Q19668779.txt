Greg Beck Whiteley (born November 11, 1969) is an American documentary film director, producer, and writer, known for New York Doll (2005), Resolved (2007), Mitt (2014), and Most Likely To Succeed (2015).

Whiteley’s documentaries have garnered two Emmy nominations and three premieres at the Sundance Film Festival.

Early life and education

Whiteley was born in Provo, Utah to parents Jessie and Kent Whiteley. He was raised in Bellevue, Washington where he attended Interlake High School and became a two-time debate state champion.

He served a two-year LDS mission from 1989-1991 on the Navajo Nation in New Mexico. He graduated from Brigham Young University in 1995 with a BA in film and received an MFA in film from Art Center College of Design in 2001.

Career

After winning two Clio Awards during graduate school at Art Center, he was hired by Populuxe Pictures to direct commercials.

From 1996 to 2000, Whiteley served as the head of Film Actors Theater in Los Angeles. While beginning work on New York Doll in 2005, he launched One Potato Productions with his wife, Erin. He named the company in homage to his recently deceased father, who grew up on an Idaho potato farm.

Whiteley wrote, filmed, and produced New York Doll in 2005. This documentary explores the history of the punk rock band New York Dolls, focusing on the life of bassist Arthur Kane after he converts to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He then created Resolved in 2006, which follows the story of a high school debate team. Whiteley spent 2006 to 2012 filming Mitt, having gained access to the Romney family, though not his campaign staff, during both of governor Mitt Romney’s campaigns for the United States presidency. From 2012 to 2014, he created his latest film, Most Likely To Succeed, which discusses the education system in the United States and proposes ideas for its reform.

Whiteley married Erin Bybee in 1999. The couple lives in California with their son, Henry, and daughter, Scout.
