Biography

Marlene Hassan Nahon is daughter of the late Chief Minister Sir Joshua Hassan. She has a BA in History of Art and Architecture from the University of Manchester, and is currently a postgraduate student in journalism at the London School of Journalism.

After the death of the minister Charles Bruzon, she launched herself as a candidate by the Gibraltar Social Democrats (GSD) in the by-election of 4 July 2013. In a press conference, she stated that she hasn't an agenda (besides the desire to contribute positively to Gibraltar), and said that she was "disappointed" with the policy practised by the ruling party (GSLP) and willing to change the composition of the parliament, where there is an "overwhelming number of lawyers" representing both groups of parties.

Nahon received 39.95% of the total votes cast, but was not elected.
