Early life

Jennie Garth was born in Urbana, Illinois, to John and Carolyn Garth. The youngest of seven children (though the only child of both), Garth spent much of her youth on a 25-acre horse ranch in Arcola, Illinois. For a time the family stayed in Tuscola, Illinois; but eventually they settled in Glendale, Arizona, when Garth was around thirteen years old. She studied dance and modeled, and was soon discovered at a local talent competition by Hollywood scout and manager, Randy James. She attended Greenway High School as a freshman and transferred to Apollo High School in her sophomore year. Determined to become an actress, Garth would receive audition materials from Los Angeles that she would work on with local acting coach, Jean Fowler.
