 Sek Yi (1881?19 October 2003) was a Cambodian supercentenarian claimant who was reportedly the oldest person in Cambodia and one of the oldest in the world, having died at the claimed age of 122. Yi was not included in the Guinness Book of World Records due to lack of documents and because his birth certificate was lost during the Cold War era. 

Background

Researchers believe Sek Yi was born in 1881 in Ponhea Kraek District, Kampong Cham (now Tbuong Khmom). He was a tiger hunter and a martial arts expert. Yi wished to see Angkor Wat but died before he could do so. He had attempted to visit Angkor in the 1960s but the civil war prevented him from seeing it. In 2002, Sek Yi and his 108-year-old wife who was blind were invited by King Norodom Sihanouk to meet him. The couple was awarded with money and wheelchairs.

Sek Yi was a devout Buddhist. He cited reasons behind his longevity as "don't make bad karma, don't steal, and don't rape someone's wife."

Personal life

Sek Yi had two wives. He also had 12 children, 70 grandchildren, and 420 great-grandchildren.
