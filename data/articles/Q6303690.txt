Early life

Judith Steinberg grew up on Long Island in the town of Roslyn outside New York City. She earned her bachelor's degree at Princeton University and then received her Doctor of Medicine degree from Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University, where she met fellow medical student Howard Dean.

Career

After completing a fellowship in hematology at McGill University in Montreal, Steinberg moved to Burlington, Vermont, with Dean in order to set up their joint medical practice. She uses her family name "Dr. Steinberg" while in her practice to differentiate herself from her husband.
