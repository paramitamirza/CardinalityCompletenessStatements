Ignacio Uría Mendizábal (4 January 1938 - 3 December 2008) was a Spanish Basque businessman and head of construction company, Altuna y Uría.

Uría was shot dead on 3 December 2008 outside a restaurant. The attack was blamed on ETA. He had received threats from ETA. Uría had been working on a high-speed train route between the Basque Country and Madrid. Eta has threatened several companies and their workers involved in the train project as it views such construction as an imposition on the Basque Country by the Spanish and French governments.
