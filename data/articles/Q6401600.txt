Khil Raj Regmi (खिलराज रेग्मी, OGDB, OTSP, born 31 May 1949) was de facto Prime Minister of Nepal from 2013 to 2014. Regmi has served as Chief Justice of Nepal since May 2011, having been appointed by President Ram Baran Yadav after the expiry of the term of his predecessor, Chief Justice Ram Prasad Shrestha. In early 2013, the main political parties agreed to install Regmi as chairman of cabinet on a short-term basis, to oversee elections. He was sworn in on 14 March 2013 by President Yadav.

He was awarded "Asia’s Dignitary Man of the Year" at the We Care for Humanity's 3rd Global Officials of Dignity Awards, which was held at UN Millennium Hotel in August 2015.
