Awards

She also won an Emmy for NBC News' Election Night coverage in 2008.

Criticism

O'Donnell was heavily criticized by conservatives for her interview of a Sarah Palin supporter attending a book signing. While speaking with people in the line, O'Donnell pointed out the obvious inconsistency of Palin supporter Jackie Seal's wearing a shirt against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which Palin supported. Several conservative hosts and bloggers, most notably Glenn Beck, criticized O'Donnell for the interview.

In April 2010, O'Donnell implied that Newt Gingrich made racist comments at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference when he criticized Barack Obama with a basketball reference. Gingrich said: "What we need is a president, not an athlete. Shooting three-point shots may be clever, but it doesn't put anybody to work." In response to the criticism, Gingrich said, "The left is becoming a parody of itself ... she immediately said that must be a racist comment. It's relatively hard to go from 'we need somebody who is a good president more than somebody who shoots three-point shots' to 'that must have been racist.'"
