Horace Boies (December 7, 1827 - April 4, 1923) served as the 14th Governor of Iowa from 1890 to 1894 as a member of the United States Democratic Party. Boies was the only Democrat to serve in that position from 1855 to 1933, a period of 78 years.

Life before Iowa

Horace was born in Aurora, New York and started his education in the public school system. He then worked for four years as a farm laborer. It was during this time he decided to further his education. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1852. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Erie Co., 3rd D.) in 1857.

Life in Iowa

Horace moved to Waterloo, Iowa in 1867 and opened his law office. His legal career became successful.

Boies, who was once a Republican, became a Democrat after the Republican Party began supporting prohibition and high tariffs. In 1889, he was elected governor by opposing the dry Republican demand for prohibition. Reelected in 1891, he was defeated when hard times came in 1893, by Frank D. Jackson, a Republican. He was a prominent populist and advocate of bimetallism. In 1892, Boies ran a distant third in the presidential nominating contest at a Democratic National Convention handily dominated by former (and future) president Grover Cleveland. He died on April 4, 1923, in Long Beach, California. He is buried at the Elmwood Cemetery in Waterloo, Iowa.
