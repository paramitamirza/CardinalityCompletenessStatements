Albert "Al" J. Hofstede (born September 25, 1940) served two non-consecutive terms as mayor of Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, both times representing the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. His first term, as the 41st mayor, began on January 1, 1974 and ended on December 31, 1975. He was defeated by independent Charles Stenvig, who himself was serving a second term. Hofstede, however, won another term (the 43rd) beginning January 1, 1978 and finishing December 31, 1979.

Political career

Hofstede was Minneapolis's youngest mayor ever when he was first elected, at age 34. He was also Minneapolis's first Catholic mayor. Over the course of his career, he has served Minnesota governor Karl Rolvaag, been a member of the Minneapolis City Council for four years, a chairperson of the Metropolitan Council from 1971 to 1973 and mayor of Minneapolis for two terms. His position as Metropolitan Council chairperson was granted by governor Wendell Anderson.

During the years that Milwaukee Avenue, a two-block area of half-lot sized, almost identical houses were threatened, Hofstede led the way to protect them. This included him leading a tour of the area to residents, neighbors, activists and others. The houses were eventually designated an historic district.

Al Hofstede now works as an advisor at North State Advisors.

Personal life

Hofstede was born in Minneapolis on September 25, 1940. He met and married his wife, Emma Hofstede (n√©e Hild) who was formerly a schoolteacher and a nun. Al has 2 children - Emily and Albert. The Hofstedes now live in Blaine, Minnesota.

A sister-in-law, Diane Hofstede, was elected to the Minneapolis Library Board and later to the Minneapolis City Council, where she served Ward 3.
