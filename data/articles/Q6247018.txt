Political career

State legislator: 1987-present

On November 4, 1986, Marty was elected as the State Senator from Senate District 63 and sworn in on January 6, 1987, for the 75th legislative session. The 1992 legislative redistricting, in conjunction with the U.S. Census, changed Marty's Senate District from 63 to 54.

On November 7, 2006, Marty was reelected for a sixth term, winning 62.05% of the vote and carrying each of the seven suburbs in his district.

The 2012 legislative redistricting changed Marty's Senate District from 54 to 66.

1994 gubernatorial campaign

In 1994 Marty sought to unseat incumbent Republican Governor Arne Carlson. He was the endorsed nominee of the DFL party and won the DFL Primary, coming in 2% ahead of former state commerce commissioner and future Attorney General Mike Hatch. The other contenders were former Minneapolis Police Chief Tony Bouza and Richard T. Van Bergen. His self-imposed campaign finance limits, feasible in his small state senate reelection campaigns, severely handicapped his ability to reach as far as his opponent statewide. The majority of his campaign funds spent on the close DFL Primary, he lost to Governor Arne Carlson by nearly a two-to-one margin.

Four years later he was one of seven DFLers who entered the campaign, but he dropped out ofthe race without filing for office. Eventually the party settled on state Attorney General Hubert H. "Skip" Humphrey III. However, in an upset, the Reform Party candidate and former wrestler Jesse Ventura won the election.

2010 gubernatorial campaign

On December 22, 2008, Marty announced that he launched an exploratory campaign for Governor due to encouragement from health care reformers. He made a formal announcement several months later.

On Tuesday, February 2, 2010, Marty finished in fourth place in a precinct caucus straw poll with approximately 9.5 percent of the vote. Marty finished behind Minneapolis mayor R.T. Rybak and Speaker of the Minnesota House Margaret Anderson Kelliher who both drew more than 20 percent of the vote. Uncommited voters came in third with approximately 14.7 percent of the vote.

On March 31, 2010, Marty announced that state senator Patricia Torres Ray is his running mate for lieutenant governor.

On April 24, 2010, Marty withdrew from the race at the DFL state convention, after it became clear he could not win party endorsement. Marty ultimately threw his support behind the party's nominee, House Speaker Margaret Anderson Kelliher.

Support for other politicians

When the national Democratic Party was picking their 2004 presidential nominee, Marty joined State Senate Majority Leader John Hottinger in endorsing Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio. On Super Tuesday, Kucinich received 17% percent of the vote in Minnesota's presidential caucus, one of his best showings that year. During the 2008 presidential campaign, Marty was a strong supporter of Barack Obama.

Political positions

Marty is best known to Minnesota residents as an advocate on environmental issues, health care reform, and government ethics and campaign finance reform. Recently he has been known primarily for his authorship of the Minnesota Health Plan. As part of his position on campaign finance and ethics, he does not accept soft money contributions or contributions from lobbyists, and he sharply limits the amount of contributions he will accept from any one person. Among Marty's ethics legislation was the Minnesota law banning lobbyists from giving gifts to public officials. Marty opposes the public funding of stadiums and professional sports teams, outspoken in his criticism of recent proposals for new stadiums for the Minnesota Twins and Minnesota Vikings. He also is a supporter for the use of medical marijuana, and even made an appearance in the movie Super High Me.
