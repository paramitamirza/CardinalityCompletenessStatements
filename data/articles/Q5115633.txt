Chuck Muth is President of Citizen Outreach, a conservative organization based in Las Vegas, and of Citizen Outreach Foundation. He is also a professional political communications consultant.

He is a former executive director of the American Conservative Union, a National Chairman of the Republican Liberty Caucus, a Clark County, Nevada, GOP chairman and former Nevada Republican Party executive director.

Chuck Muth is a blogger, publisher of NevadaNewsandViews.com, an independent freelance columnist, an author, and a regular guest on political and public affairs TV and radio programs.

Muth lives in Las Vegas with his wife Gia, their two daughters, Kristen and Jenna, and son, "CJ".

In 2013, a Nevada state court found that Citizen Outreach had violated campaign finance laws. The organization had sent mailers attacking a Democratic state legislator, John Oceguera, without making the required disclosures of contributions and expenses. The organization was fined $10,000 and ordered to make the required disclosures. Muth said, "We will now weigh our legal options."  On appeal, the Nevada Supreme Court reversed the lower court’s ruling in February 2015, declaring that it was “undisputed that Citizen Outreach’s fliers…were not subject to regulation under Nevada’s campaign practices statutes that were effective in 2010.”
