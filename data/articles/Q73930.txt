Richard Laughlain "Lochlyn" Munro (born February 12, 1966) is a Canadian actor.

Munro is mostly known for roles in films, notably A Night at the Roxbury, Scary Movie, White Chicks and Freddy vs. Jason. For television, he is perhaps best known for his recurring role as Jack Sheridan in the supernatural drama Charmed.

Life and career

Munro was born in Lac La Hache, British Columbia, and started his acting career after a serious sports injury ended his dream of playing professional ice hockey. While playing music in various clubs around Vancouver, Munro studied drama and improvisational comedy. Munro landed roles on various American projects such as 21 Jump Street (1987) and Wiseguy (1987).

Munro has starred in two Moment of Truth movies: Stand Against Fear, as a high-school jock who uses his popularity for all the wrong reasons, and Abduction of Innocence, as the boyfriend-turned-kidnapper of a teenage lumber heiress. Munro played Jack Sheridan on Charmed and appeared on Without A Trace, CSI, CSI: Miami and CSI: NY playing three different characters. He appeared as Paul Musevini, a time traveling patriarch of a genetically-enhanced Nietzschean race, in "Pride Before the Fall", the 100th episode of Andromeda.
