Smarter Every Day

History

Smarter Every Day was originally called Pennywhistle Productions.

On July 10, 2009 Destin had his first video reach 1 million views.  The video was about chicken head tracking using some chickens that Destin bought for his father as a demonstration. Because of its popularity this video retroactively had Smarter Every Day added to its name. Mercedes-Benz capitalized on the popularity of this video in their "MAGIC BODY CONTROL TV commercial Chicken".

On Apr 24, 2011, starting with a video entitled "Detonation vs Deflagration - Smarter Every Day 1," Destin officially began the web-series, Smarter Every Day, which has now taken over the whole identity of his YouTube channel.
