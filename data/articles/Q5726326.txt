Henry Nicholas Greenwell (1826-1891) was an English merchant credited with establishing Kona coffee as an internationally known brand.His family became major land-holders in the Kona District of the island of Hawaii.The Greenwell Store is now a museum and historical center.

Life

Henry Nicholas Greenwell was born 9 January 1826 in Lanchester, County Durham, England. His father was William Thomas Greenwell (1777-1856) and mother was Dorothy Smales (1789-1871).His oldest brother was William Greenwell (1820-1918)  an English archaeologist who became canon at Durham Cathedral.  His sister Dorothy (1821-1882) published poetry under the name Dora Greenwell. He had two other older brothers Francis Greenwell (1823-1894) and Alan Greenwell (1824-1914).As fourth son he had little chance of inheriting the family estate called Greenwell Ford.He attended Durham School and Royal Military Academy Sandhurst expecting a military career.

In 1844 Greenwell purchased a commission as a Lieutenant in the 70th Regiment of the British Army which was stationed in Ireland during the great Famine. He became disenchanted, sold his commission in 1847 and on 15 March 1848, left for Melbourne, Australia. Arriving in June 1848, he traveled to Sydney looking for a sheep or cattle station, but came instead to California in 1849 for the California Gold Rush.When the ship arrived in San Francisco, the crew immediately left and headed for the gold fields, leaving him with goods he intended to sell.After injuring himself unloading, he sailed to the Hawaiian Islands in January 1850 to recover.After a brief time in Honolulu working at the H. J. Holdsworth store, he moved to Kailua-Kona, and opened his own retail store in the Kona District in late 1850.

In late 1852 one of his Chinese servants died after being accused of theft. Greenwell was arrested and charged with second degree murder. Asher B. Bates was prosecutor, William Little Lee judge, and a jury of British subjects was found for the trial in January 1853. Witnesses testified that Greenwell had beaten or whipped the man, but others said the man was already ill and that Greenwell treated his employees fairly.After half an hour the jury unanimously found him not guilty.The case formed a precedent still cited in the Hawaii state criminal code.

He became successful growing Oranges to send to the expanding California market. However, in 1866 the crop was destroyed by blight, so he looked to diversify.In 1867 on what would be a circumnavigation of the earth, he visited New Zealand and returned to England to visit family. On his return he picked up a new variety of Oranges in Brazil, and ideas for other potential crops. He also met his future wife on the voyage.Greenwell married Elizabeth Caroline Hall (1841-1934) 9 April 1868 and had six sons, four daughters, and 23 grandchildren. The new crop being grown in this area was coffea, the tree bearing the fruit made into "beans" for coffee. The first trees were brought to the Kona area by missionaries at nearby Kahikolu Church in the late 1820s.The few earlier attempts had uneven results, but the Greenwell brand developed a reputation for consistent quality for Kona coffee.

Greenwell served as Collector of Customs at the port at Kealakekua Bay, and as Postmaster and area School Superintendent.A stone building was built just south of the wooden house, in the traditional land division (ahupuaa) known as Kalukalu (for a type of grass that grows there).The oranges continued to be mentioned by travelers through the area.

Isabella Bird, who knew Dora in England, visited the Greenwells in 1873. Greenwell's coffee was honored at the 1873 World's Fair in Vienna. In 1876 Greenwell provided coffee as part of the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.The Greenwell family traded in sheep skins and dairy products, eventually using the profits to buy more land in the area. Coffee only grows in a narrow elevation band, so drier areas above the usual cloud cover were used as pasture land for cattle, sheep, and horses.Early in 1879, the royal physician Georges Phillipe Trousseau sold all of his holdings in Kona to Greenwell.Other lands were purchased from the family of missionary John Davis Paris.

Legacy

Greenwell died 18 May 1891 aboard a steamer that he often took between the islands.He and many family members are buried at the Christ Church Episcopal cemetery, near the store on the Hawaii Belt Road.Elizabeth Greenwell operated the store after his death, and many children and grandchildren became active in farming and ranching on the nearby lands.

While the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 had caused most large Hawaii coffee plantations to convert to sugarcane, this was not practical in the steep Kona district. Instead, small plots were leased to individual families, often Chinese, Japanese, or Portuguese immigrants after their labor contracts on sugar plantations expired. Quality improved further with the introduction of the Guatemalan variety via Hermann A. Widemann, which turned out to be well-adapted to higher elevations; it remains a popular variety through modern times.

First-born son William Henry Greenwell was born at Kalukalu 7 June 1869.His sons included Henry Alan Greenwell (1908-1919), Jack Brysson Greenwell (1910-1996) and another Henry Alan Greenwell (1919-1992).William H. Greenwell managed the business from 1891 until he died 17 June 1927 after an operation for apendicitis.William's wife Maud Annandale Johnstone (1883-1976), named for Annandale, Scotland where she was born, ran the store until the 1950s. The wooden house was torn down in the 1960s.

Second and third sons continued the ranching business divided into three main ranches after 1927. Fourth son Wilfrid Alan Greenwell was born 7 November 1878, graduated from Yale in 1905, became a lawyer and married Lulu J. Law in November 1910. He became a partner in the firm Robertson, Castle & Olson in Honolulu and died in 1931.Leonard Lanchester Greenwell was born 4 December 1884 married Dora Beebe in 1909 and died in January 1975 in California.Fifth son Julian Greenwell was born 2 September 1880 and died 20 May 1960.Daughter Dora Caroline Greenwell was born 15 October 1870, married Gerald E. Bryant 6 September 1894, and died in 1952.Daughter Elizabeth Greenwell was born in 1873, married Howard R. Bryant in 1893, and died in 1903.Daughter Christina Margaret Greenwell was born 16 September 1874, married Jordan Natscheff in 1910 and died in 1964.
