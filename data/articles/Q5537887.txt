George Horatio Charles Cholmondeley, 5th Marquess of Cholmondeley  (; 19 May 1883 - 16 September 1968), styled Earl of Rocksavage from birth until 1923, was a British peer.  He was the Lord Great Chamberlain of England in 1936 and also between 1952 and 1966.

Personal

Cholmondeley was a direct descendant of Sir Robert Walpole, the first Prime Minister of Great Britain. He was the son of George Cholmondeley, 4th Marquess of Cholmondeley and Winifred Ida Kingscote. In the years before he succeeded to his father's title, he was a well-known tennis and polo player.

He was also an authority on penmanship, championing a script which became known as the "Cholmondeley Italic," and was the first president of the Society for Italic Handwriting. In 1950, he established the Cholmondeley Prize, a handwriting contest between the students of Eton and Harrow. Winchester joined in 1952 and the schools have continued the annual competition since.

Military career

Cholmondeley fought in the Second Boer War (1899-1901), serving as a "Railway Staff Officer", first with the Royal Sussex Regiment and from October 1901 as Second Lieutenant of the 9th Lancers. In 1905, he attained the rank of Lieutenant in the 9th Lancers. He was Aide-de-Camp to the Viceroy of India, and he fought in the First World War, during which he gained the rank of Captain in the 9th Lancers.

Cholmondeley succeeded to his father's land, estates and title in 1923, and his inherited title became Marquess of Cholmondeley. In the 1953 Coronation Honours, he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order.

Lands and estates

The family seats are Houghton Hall, Norfolk, and Cholmondeley Castle, which is surrounded by a 7500 acre estate near Malpas, Cheshire.

The Cholmondeleys bought Wenbans near Wadhurst in Sussex in the mid-1890s. After major restoration work in the 1920s and 1930s, the rustic farm only 50 mi from London was reported to have been used as a romantic getaway by the Prince of Wales, who later became Edward VIII. The property was sold around the time of the abdication crisis of 1936 and the accession of George VI.

Position at court

One moiety part of the ancient office of Lord Great Chamberlain is a Cholmondeley inheritance. This hereditary honour came into the Cholmondeley family through the marriage of the first Marquess of Cholmondeley to Lady Georgiana Charlotte Bertie, daughter of Peregrine Bertie, 3rd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven. The second, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh holders of the marquessate have all held this office.

The Marquess bore the Royal Standard at the Coronation of King George VI in 1937.

Family

The wealth of the Cholmondeley family was greatly enhanced by Cholmondeley's marriage to Sybil Sassoon (1894-1989), a member of the Sassoon family, a Jewish banking family with origins in Baghdad and India, and heiress to her brother Sir Philip Sassoon. The couple were married on 6 August 1913, and they had two sons and one daughter:

	 Lady Aline Caroline Cholmondeley (5 October 1916 - 30 June 2015)

	 George Henry Hugh, 6th Marquess of Cholmondeley (24 April 1919 - 1990)

	 Lord John George Cholmondeley (15 November 1920 - October 1986)
