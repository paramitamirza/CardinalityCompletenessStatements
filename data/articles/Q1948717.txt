Brittany "McKey" Sullivan (born September 9, 1988) is an American fashion model most notable as the winner of the eleventh cycle of America's Next Top Model.

Early life

Sullivan was born to Michael and Gayle Sullivan and has three siblings, Bridgette, Jimmy, and Mikey. She is a graduate of Lake Forest High School and attended Ripon College where she majored in government and chemical biology  and was a member of Alpha Delta Pi sorority. She has come back to Ripon College again to start her life as a student to pursue her degree. She also trains in mixed martial arts with her husband, Sam Alvey. She was known for appearing at the Bristol Renaissance Faire, which inspired her medieval fashion sense. Sullivan got into modeling when she tried out for Elite Model Look following a sports injury and won the regional division of the competition.

America's Next Top Model

Sullivan competed in Cycle 11 against thirteen other contestants, ultimately winning the competition.

Two other contestants named Brittany (or some variation) also competed in Cycle 11, so Sullivan and Brittney Brown were asked by Tyra Banks to change their names for the show. Sullivan chose 'McKey' since her mother was considering naming her McKenzie when she was born and since it was her penname in high school. She plans on continuing to use the name beyond this television season. She came into the competition with shoulder-length bright red hair but was later given makeover to short black hair.

Throughout the competition, she became one of the front-runners with two collective first call-outs and never placed below fifth. During her go-see challenge in Amsterdam, she was booked by all of the four designers that she met, despite being disqualified from the challenge when she returned to the agency outside of the time limit. She went on to beat Samantha Potter for the title. She became the second winner to never have a bottom two appearance, with Jaslene Gonzalez being the first. This record was succeeded by Nicole Fox, Krista White, Sophie Sumner, and Jourdan Miller.

As part of the ANTM prize package awarded to her, Sullivan appeared on the cover of Seventeen Magazine with a 6-page editorial and received a contract with CoverGirl cosmetics and a contract for representation with Elite Model Management. She will be featured in Wal-Mart campaign, as well as in the national CoverGirl campaign ads. Her win also comprises a billboard in Times Square.
