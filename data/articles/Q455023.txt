Biography

Pécresse is the daughter of Dominique Roux (CEO of Bolloré telecom since January 2007).

Pécresse has degrees from HEC Paris and ÉNA. She was an auditor of the Conseil d'État until 1998, when she was designated Counselor of the President of the French Republic. She speaks French, English, Russian and Japanese.

In June 2002, she was elected deputy of the Yvelines' second constituency. She was also elected regional counselor of Île-de-France in 2004. Valérie Pécresse was a national spokeswoman of the UMP, and spokeswoman of the party in the Yvelines.

On 18 May 2007, she was designated Minister of Higher Education and Research of François Fillon's second cabinet.

There, she has launched many reforms which have caused a great wave of strikes.

In 2009, the Académie de la Carpette anglaise, an organization that opposes the spread of the English language in Francophone countries, gave Pécresse the Prix de la Carpette Anglaise ("English Doormat Prize") for having refused to speak French at international meetings in Brussels, Belgium; Pécresse had stated that English was the easiest means of communication.

After the defeat of Nicolas Sarkozy in the French presidential election of 2012, Valérie Pécresse remains a key member of the Union for a Popular Movement. She announced that she would be supporting former Prime Minister François Fillon in his bid for the UMP Presidency, stating that it was an act of loyalty, as Fillon has always supported her during her tenure as Minister, especially when her position was threatened by street protests.
