Archie Aldis "Red" Emmerson (born 1929) is an American businessman, the founder of Sierra Pacific Industries, a lumber products company that owns 1.9 million acres of woodland in northern California and western Washington. He was the third largest landowner in the US in 2011.

Early life

Born in Grand Ronde, Oregon in 1929, and lived his early years in meager surroundings. He attended school while his father, R.H. "Curly" Emmerson built sawmills in Oregon and California. 

Career

In 1948, at age 19, Emmerson arrived in Arcata, California where he began working in mills learning as much as he could about every job in the plant.

In 1949 Emmerson and his father formed a partnership and went into the lumber business together, eventually producing manufacturing facilities in the northwest. Under Emmerson’s management the company grew into Sierra Pacific Industries (SPI) - now the second largest lumber producer in the U.S.

As of 2011, he is the third largest private land owner in the United States.

Philanthropy

Through the Sierra Pacific Foundation, Emmerson gave millions of dollars in community contributions. The Foundation was established in 1979 by Red’s father. Over the years, Red has continued to fund the Foundation to meet its philanthropic commitment to worthy organizations, community projects, youth activities, and student scholarships for the communities where the company has operating facilities.

Personal life

He is married with three children and lives in Redding, California. His sons George and Mark are president and chairman of SPI.
