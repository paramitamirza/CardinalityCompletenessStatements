Political career

Killeen first became involved in politics in 1985 when he was elected to Clare County Council and served on that body until 1997. He was chairman from 1989-1991. At the 1992 general election he was elected to Dáil Éireann for the Clare constituency for the first time and retained his seat at each subsequent election until his retirement in 2011.

Killeen has served on a number of committees, including the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education and Science, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the Committee on Members' Interests in Dáil Éireann.

On 23 March 2010 Taoiseach Brian Cowen appointed Killeen as Minister of Defence replacing Willie O'Dea who had resigned due to an affidavit controversy.

On 6 January 2011, Killeen announced his decision not to contest the 2011 general election, citing medical advice as his reason, having been diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2008. He resigned as Minister for Defence on 19 January 2011.
