Martirez joined KTTV in October 1995 as a general assignment reporter for the station’s morning news and its Good Day LA program.

Prior to arriving at KTTV Martirez worked at the Denver CBS-affiliate KCNC anchoring their morning newscasts. In Denver from 1993-1995, Martirez hosted an Emmy Award winning syndicated children’s newsmagazine “News for Kids”.

In Early October Martirez stopped appearing on the Fox 11 Morning news. This led many people to speculate whether Martirez had been axed from Fox after seeing the departures of Dorothy Lucey and Jillian Reynolds. Jean quickly denied rumors by stating on Twitter that she was still with the show and just on sick leave. A few days later she finally hinted at her departure in a tweet that she had cleaned out her desk. Lucey soon confirmed Martirez's departure on her blog.
