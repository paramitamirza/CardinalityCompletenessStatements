Edward Griffin "Holy Terror" Hitchcock (1837-1898) was a law enforcement officer in the Kingdom of Hawaii, who rose to the position of Marshal of the Republic of Hawaii.

Life

Edward Griffin Hitchcock was born January 20, 1837 in Lahaina on the island of Maui. His father was early missionary Harvey Rexford Hitchcock (1800-1855), and mother was Rebecca Howard (1808-1890). They were assigned the mission station called Kaluaaha on the eastern end of the island of Molokai. He attended Punahou School from 1847 to 1853.He married Mary Tenney Castle (1838-1926), daughter of Castle & Cooke founder Samuel Northrup Castle (1808-1894) on April 11, 1862.He managed the family sugar plantation at PƒÅpaikou.

He was appointed as Sheriff of the island of Hawaii on April 5, 1888.In December 1889, deputy sheriff Rufus Anderson Lyman informed him of the lynching case of Japanese immigrant Katsu Goto in Honokaa. Hitchcock tracked down his suspects who were tried and found guilty, but they were later pardoned and freed by the new government. The episode was dramatized in a 2001 play by Eric Anderson "Another Heaven", and a memorial was erected in Honokaa for Goto.

After the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in early 1893, Marshal Charles Burnett Wilson was viewed as loyal to deposed Queen Liliuokalani. Hitchcock replaced Wilson as Marshal, the highest law enforcement officer in the country.His effectiveness at rounding up suspects and his ties to missionaries earned him the nickname "Holy Terror".

He lived in the capital Honolulu while serving as Marshal of the Provisional Government of Hawaii and the Republic of Hawaii.One of the first of several uprisings he faced was called the Leper War. He ordered victims of Leprosy to the remote colony of Kalaupapa. Some on the island of kauai had to be captured by force. The Kalaupapa colony was considered more like a prison than a medical facility. A leader of the uprising named Koolau was dramatized in the Jack London short story "Koolau the Leper".

The 1895 Counter-Revolution in Hawaii, was an organized armed revolt on the capital. After an initial victory by the Royalists, on January 7, 1895 President Sanford B. Dole declared martial law and employed troops and artillery. Hitchcock eventually arrested the leaders and the Queen. Hitchcock resigned on August 1, 1895 and Arthur M. Brown, who had served as Hitchcock's deputy, became the new Marshal. He returned to his island Sheriff duties, until he was appointed circuit court judge of the island of Hawaii in October 1896 replacing Antone Rosa.
