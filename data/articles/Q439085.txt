Storey was born without a functioning left hand after her arm became entangled in the umbilical cord in the womb.

She set a distance of 45.502 km, which was 563m short of Leontien Zijlaard-van Moorsel's 2003 overall world record - however Storey's distance did set a new world record in the C5 Paralympic cycling class as well as a new British record.
