Donal Moynihan (born 2 October 1941) is a former Irish Fianna Fáil politician who was a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Cork North-West constituency from 1982 to 1989 and from 1992 to 2007.

Moynihan was born in Ballymakeera, County Cork in 1941. He was educated at Ballyvourney Vocational School, and worked as a farmer before entering politics on a full-time basis. He is married to Catherine Twomey with whom he has nine children. Moyniahn first became involved in politics when he was co-opted onto Cork County Council in 1970, taking over his father's seat which the elder Moynihan had held since 1928. Donal Moynihan was first elected to Dáil Éireann at the November 1982 general election. He retained his seat until the 1989 general election, when he lost out to his running mate, Laurence Kelly.

Moynihan regained his seat at the 1992 general election, unseating Kelly in the process and was re-elected at the 1997 and 2002 general elections. In Dáil Éireann, he was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Heritage and the Irish language, and was also a member of the Joint House Services Committee. He lost his seat at the 2007 general election to party colleague Batt O'Keeffe.
