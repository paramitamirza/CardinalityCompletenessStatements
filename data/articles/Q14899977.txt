Oisín Quinn is an Irish Labour Party politician and a former Lord Mayor of Dublin.

Quinn was first elected to Dublin City Council in the 2004 Irish local elections for the Rathmines Local electoral area. Quinn was an unsuccessful candidate for Dáil Éireann in the Dún Laoghaire constituency at the 2007 general election. He was re-elected in June 2009 for the Pembroke-Rathmines electoral area, and was elected Lord Mayor of Dublin in 2013.

Quinn has called for the direct election of Dublin's mayor, saying that direct election is a necessity if Dublin wants to compete with other similarly-sized cities across Europe.

Quinn studied law at University College Dublin and the London School of Economics, and qualified as a barrister from the King's Inns in 1992. His uncle is the former Minister for Education and Skills, Ruairi Quinn. He is the son of a former AIB Director Lochlann Quinn.

He lost his council seat at the 2014 local elections.
