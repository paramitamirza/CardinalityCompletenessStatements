Luiz Carlos Alborghetti (Andradina, São Paulo, February 12, 1945  -  Curitiba, Paraná, December 9, 2009) was an Italian-Brazilian radio commenter, showman and political figure. He was a Conservative voice on the radio. Among his program casting characteristics, he was notable for some peculiar details: reading glasses, a pen in-between the fingers of his right hand, a facial towel hanging on his shoulders and (mainly) his acid, challenging speeches (regularly full of obscene words and gestures) and a solid wood club which he ostensively used to smack on anything near him (mostly his table) when angered. After several months off-work for health treatment, Alborghetti died of lung cancer.

Alborghetti was a Paraná state deputy from 1986 to 2002.
