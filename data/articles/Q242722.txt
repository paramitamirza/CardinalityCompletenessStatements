Early life

Le Brock was born in New York City, but brought up in London, United Kingdom. She is the daughter of a French-Canadian father who owned a quicksilver mine and opened The General Thurber Inn, a three-star Michelin restaurant in Rouses Point, New York. Kelly's Irish mother, a former model, was the owner of fine antique stores in London. Le Brock spent her early school days in Buckinghamshire, England and Lewes, Sussex (1969-1976). At the age of 16, Le Brock returned to New York and started her career as a high fashion and beauty model.

Career

Modeling

Le Brock began her career as a model at age 16. She went on to appear on numerous magazine covers and in fashion spreads, including an exclusive Christian Dior campaign, and became one of Eileen Ford's most sought-after models. She also gained notoriety as the Pantene shampoo commercial spokeswoman whose line "Don't hate me because I'm beautiful" became a pop-culture catchphrase.

Film

Le Brock was cast as the "perfect" or "fantasy" woman in films such as The Woman in Red (1984) and Weird Science (1985). As a result, she was considered one of the sexiest women in Hollywood in the 1980s. In 1990, she starred opposite her then-husband, Steven Seagal, in Hard to Kill. Le Brock also appeared in Betrayal of the Dove (1993), Tracks of a Killer (1995), and Hard Bounty (1995).

She had roles in the films Wrongfully Accused (1998), The Sorcerer's Apprentice (2002), Zerophilia (2005), and Gamers: The Movie (2006 film). Le Brock says that she is hoping to get back into acting. She has appeared in four films since 2000, as well as a thriller entitled Hidden Affairs— released in 2013.

Television

In 2005, Le Brock was the captain of the team "Kelly's Bellies" on VH1's Celebrity Fit Club reality show. Le Brock also appeared on the third UK series of Hell's Kitchen.

Personal life

Her first marriage was to film producer and restaurateur, Victor Drai, in 1984; they divorced in 1986. She then was married to action star Steven Seagal from 1987 to 1996, from which three children were born — Annaliza (b. 1987), Dominic (b. 1990), and Arissa (b. 1993).

In the late 1980s, Le Brock was one of the first private U.S. citizens to own a hyperbaric chamber. Le Brock also started her own brand of homeopathic remedies.
