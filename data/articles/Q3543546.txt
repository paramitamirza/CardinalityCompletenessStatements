Claudine Barretto (born Claudine Margaret Castelo Barretto; July 20, 1979) is a Filipino film and television actress. She is best known for her lead role in the television series Mula Sa Puso (1997-1999) alongside the late Rico Yan, of which a film adaptation was released after its run and a remake later on. As a film actress, she has received two FAMAS Awards for Best Actress and a Luna Award for Best Actress.

Barretto is also noted for her shows such as Saan Ka Man Naroroon (1999-2001), Sa Dulo Ng Walang Hanggan (2001-2003), ASAP (2003-2009), Marina (2004) and Iisa Pa Lamang (2008). Her popular film works include Anak (2000), Got 2 Believe (2002), Kailangan Kita (2002), Milan (2004), Nasaan Ka Man (2005) and Sukob (2006). Barretto was managed by ABS-CBN from 1992 until she transferred to GMA Network in 2009.

In 2011, Barretto's contract with GMA Network was not renewed. She has been involved as well in much-publicized issues including an airport incident, civil cases against her husband and malicious drug-usage allegations that sent her career on hiatus.

In June 2015, Barretto recently returned to her original home network, ABS-CBN.
