Bomani described himself in his own words

A College professor once described me as a resourceful, moderate revolutionary, with a talent to organize and mobilize people. I was Julius Nyereres right hand man during the fight for independence. The Sukuma people were the largest tribe in Tanganyika and more than a quarter of the countrys population lived in the Lake zone. I was able to galvanized the support of the 50 traditional chiefs of Sukumaland and commanded their great respect and trust . Because of the success o our grassroots social and business organizations that existed prior to the formation of TANU I was also able to draw unequaled goodwill from the confidence and faith of the ordinary people of Sukuma, who had given me the affectionate nickname " Kishamapanda" - meaning. " The trailblazer". The full support that the movement for political independence received from the less populous areas of the country enabled Tanganyika to become the first country among the four East African States to attain political independence.
