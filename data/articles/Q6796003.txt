Maxine Wilson is the former mayor of Coquitlam, British Columbia.  

Born in 1946 in Portland, Oregon, Wilson grew up on a family farm. In 1959, Wilson moved to Canada with her parents and sister. The family settled in Dawson Creek, British Columbia, where her father bought a farm.

Her position on the School District 43 School Board lasted ten years, four in which she chaired.

In 1998, she was elected to the Coquitlam City Council, and in 2005 won a close race for mayoralty against incumbent mayor Jon Kingsbury. She lost the 2008 race to Richard Stewart.
