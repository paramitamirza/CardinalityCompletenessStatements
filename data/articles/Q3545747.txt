She also won the Supporting Actress of the Year in the Film Academy of the Philippines for Una Kang Naging Akin. She was also declared by the Guillermo Mendoza Memorial Foundation Entertainment Award as the Box Office Queen of 1994 for starring in that year's highest-grossing film: The Maggie Dela Riva Story...God Why Me?

The only person in Philippine movie history to ever bag two acting awards in a single ceremony from any awards night (Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress in the 1991 FAMAS Awards).

Her other Best Actress honors include the 1993 Metro Manila Film Festival for Kung Mawawala Ka Pa; 1993 FAMAS for Kung Mawawala Ka Pa; and 1994 Philippine Movie Press Club (PMPC) Star Awards for Movies for Buhay ng Buhay Ko.

In 1996, Zulueta starred with 90's rising star and former child star Sheryl Cruz and 1994 Beauty Queen Charlene Gonzales in the hit drama-vengeance film Ikaw Naman Ang Iiyak for Viva Films in a lead role as Elaine, which became a career booster as a lead actress. In the same year, Zulueta was cited in a Manila Times article as the 10th Best Filipino Actress from 1970 to 1996. In addition, a 1999 Manila Standard article named her as one of the Top 10 Actresses of the 1990s.
