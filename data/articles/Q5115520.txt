Charles Robert "Chuck" Henry (born January 1, 1946) is an American journalist. Henry can be seen co-anchoring the 5, 6 and 11 PM newscasts on KNBC-TV. Before anchoring at KNBC, he worked for 19 years at KABC-TV, where he served as reporter, anchor, director and producer (1971-78, 82-93).

Henry gained national attention in October 2003, when he and his cameraman were nearly killed in the field while shooting a report about California forest fires. Although the newspeople were told to leave by the fire department, a sudden change in wind direction prevented Henry from doing so. Their van was engulfed and lost to the fire and the team had to be rescued by the LAFD.

Henry joined the NBC 4 staff in January 1994 (just several days after his 48th birthday), replacing John Beard as anchor of the 4 P.M. news and also as a reporter. Later in 1997, Henry replaced Jess Marlow on the 6 P.M. newscast, which he continues to do every night in addition to the 5 P.M. and 11 P.M. newscasts after the retirement of Paul Moyer. Henry is also well known for hosting (and executive-producing) Travel Café, a travel program in which he flies all around the world highlighting food and travel. Travel Café, a two-time Emmy Award winner, was the first local (Los Angeles) TV series produced in HDTV and is also seen on the Travel Channel. 

In 1989, Henry hosted a short-lived revival of the classic game show Now You See It on CBS.

From 1984 to 1991, Henry was the host and in 1988 added producer/director to the popular travel magazine program, “Eye on L.A.” He has visited every continent in the world as host of these programs, which he received several Emmys. 

Henry was previously a news anchor-reporter at WMAQ-TV, the NBC-owned television station in Chicago, Illinois from 1978 to 1982. He began his career in broadcasting at KHVH-TV in Honolulu as news anchor-reporter from 1966 to 1971 with a short interval in Anchorage, Alaska, as a news anchor-reporter for KENI-TV from 1967 to 1968.
