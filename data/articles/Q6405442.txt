Kieran O'Donnell (born 8 May 1963) is an Irish Fine Gael politician. He is a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Limerick City constituency. 

Before becoming a full-time public representative, O'Donnell worked as an accountant. He is a nephew of Tom O'Donnell, a former Minister and TD for Limerick East.

O'Donnell was an unsuccessful candidate at the 2002 Seanad election. He was elected on his first attempt to Limerick County Council for the Castleconnell electoral area in 2004. He was elected to Dáil Éireann at the 2007 general election. 

In October 2007 O'Donnell was appointed party deputy spokesperson on Finance, with special responsibility for Freedom of Information, Procurement Reform and the Office of Public Works. As deputy spokesperson, O'Donnell was given the full Finance portfolio on an acting basis by Enda Kenny on 14 June 2010 when Kenny sacked Richard Bruton. O'Donnell subsequently supported Richard Bruton's leadership challenge to Enda Kenny. Following Kenny's victory in a motion of confidence, O'Donnell was not appointed to the front bench. In October 2010 he was appointed as party deputy spokesperson on Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, with special responsibility for Enterprise and Employment.
