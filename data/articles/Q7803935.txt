Timothy Logan McCurdy (born 16 January 1963) is an Australian politician, and has been a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly since 2010, representing Murray Valley until 2014 and Ovens Valley thereafter.

In October 2014, it was revealed that McCurdy had been accused by a former staffer, Jillian McGillivray, of harassment and bullying, with lawyers for McGillivray expecting her case to be listed before the Wangaratta Magistrates Court in November. McCurdy denied any wrongdoing.
