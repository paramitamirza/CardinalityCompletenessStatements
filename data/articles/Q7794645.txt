Thomas V. "Mike" Miller, Jr. (born December 3, 1942) is the current president of the Maryland Senate. He has been a state senator representing the 27th District since 1975 and has served as president since January 1987, longer than any other senate president in Maryland history.

Miller was born in Clinton, Maryland, and attended Surrattsville High School. He graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park with a B.S. in business administration in 1964, and graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law in 1967 with LL.B. and J.D. degrees.  In 1971, he was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates from the third legislative district of Maryland in Prince George's County, and served in that position until his election to the state senate in 1975. He is a Democrat but tends to have a fairly conservative viewpoint although he battled former Republican Governor Bob Ehrlich over a variety of issues. He supports the re-introduction of slot machine gambling.

The Senate office building in Annapolis is named after him due to his being the longest-serving Senate president in the history of the state legislature. Miller is also believed to be the longest-serving Senate President of any state senate in United States history.

The first of ten siblings, Senator Miller is married, has five children and fourteen grandchildren, and lives in Chesapeake Beach, Maryland.
