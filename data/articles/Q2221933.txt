Personal life

Nesbitt has been married four times and has five children from his various marriages. His first three marriages all ended in divorce.

In 1961 he married his first wife, the actress Anne Aubrey, and they had a daughter the next year. On 25 January 1973 he was fined Â£250 when he pleaded guilty to two charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in October the previous year. He thrashed her with a leather strap after she told him that she was having an affair with another man. He also bruised her by grabbing her clothing the next day when she refused to tell him details about her lover. She divorced him a few months later.

Fairly soon after this he married his second wife Susan, and they had at least one child.  His third wife was an Australian beauty queen, and for a time he moved to her country. As of 2014, he lives in Worthing, West Sussex, with his fourth wife Miranda.
