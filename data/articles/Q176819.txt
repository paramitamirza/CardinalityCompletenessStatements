He had more than two decades of experience as a District Attorney, and more than three decades of experience as a prosecutor.

On January 3, 1983, Sneddon became the 33rd District Attorney of Santa Barbara County and has been re-elected without opposition for five terms. In 2010 he retired from the DA's office.

A father of 9 children, Sneddon was Chair of the Committee for Child Support Enforcement since its inception in 1991. He was presented with a "Director's Award" in 1995 by the California Family Support Council. A year later he was appointed co-chair of the National District Attorney's Child Support Committee and invited by the US Attorney General Janet Reno to be a member of the Presidential Commission's Federal Task Force to review and enhance federal criminal prosecutions for failure to pay child support.

Prosecution of Michael Jackson

His most publicized cases were his two investigations of Michael Jackson on child sexual abuse allegations in 1993 and 2005. The first criminal investigation was closed with no charges. Jackson settled a related civil suit with a civil settlement of over $15 million to the plaintiff Jordan Chandler. Chandler ceased cooperating with investigators after two grand juries returned a refusal to indict Jackson. The second set of allegations against Jackson resulted in a long trial which ended on June 13, 2005 with Jackson being acquitted.
