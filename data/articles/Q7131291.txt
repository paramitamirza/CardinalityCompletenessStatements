Pankaj Ramanbhai Patel (born 1951) is the current Chairman and Managing Director of Cadila Healthcare, the fifth largest pharmaceutical company in India. Patel was tied for 26th place on Forbes magazine's first annual list of the 40 richest Indians (2004) with an estimated net worth of $510 million.

Patel was named the "Best Pharma Man of the year 2003" by the Foundation of Indian Industry and Economists in recognition of the growth of Cadila under his leadership. At that time, Patel predicted that Zydus Cadila would become the third-largest pharmaceutical company in India by 2005. However, the company's fortunes were reversed and Patel fell out of the list of richest Indians by 2005.

Patel holds Bachelor of Pharmacy and Master of Pharmacy degrees from Gujarat University, as well as a BA in Science and Law from the University of Mumbai.
