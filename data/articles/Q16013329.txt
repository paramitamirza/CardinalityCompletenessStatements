Jacqueline Barbara Vaughn (n√©e Robinson; July 27, 1935 - January 22, 1994) was an American Chicago Public Schools special education teacher and labor leader.

She led what has been called one of the "mightiest teachers unions in the nation." Vaughn was famous for her fashion sense and her no-nonsense negotiation style in contract talks. Her ability to build consensus between the leadership team, the teachers and school support staff garnered respect from those in and out to the educational system. Vaughn spent much of her career trying to reform the educational system. Through her vision, the CTU Quest Center was created to give school professionals a place to design more effective teaching methods and student learning techniques. Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley called Jacqueline Vaughn "a courageous and tireless champion for men and women working in our most noble profession, teaching."

1987 Strike

The strike in 1987 lasted 4 weeks, from September 8 to October 4  and resulted in a pay increase for teachers and reductions in class size. It was the longest strike in Chicago history.
