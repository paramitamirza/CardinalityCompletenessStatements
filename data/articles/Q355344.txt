William Dwight Schultz (born November 24, 1947) is an American stage, television, film actor and voice artist. He is best known for his roles as Captain "Howling Mad" Murdock on the 1980s action series The A-Team, and as Reginald Barclay in Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Voyager and the film Star Trek: First Contact. He is also well known in animation as the mad scientist Dr. Animo in the Ben 10 series, Chef Mung Daal in the children's cartoon Chowder, and Eddie the Squirrel in CatDog.

Early life

Schultz was born in Baltimore, Maryland. He is an alumnus of Towson University.

Career

Schultz's breakthrough role was the character of Captain "Howling Mad" Murdock on The A-Team. Schultz has also appeared in films including The Fan (1981) with Broadway Actress Lauren Bacall, and starred in Fat Man and Little Boy (1989), as J. Robert Oppenheimer.

He auditioned for the part of Dr. Wayne Fiscus on the television show St. Elsewhere, but lost out to Howie Mandel.

In the early 1990s, he had a recurring role as Lieutenant Reginald Barclay in Star Trek: The Next Generation. Schultz reprised the role for a few episodes of Star Trek: Voyager and the film Star Trek: First Contact.

In November 2009, he confirmed that he (and former A-Team co-star, Dirk Benedict) would have a cameo in the feature film The A-Team, however, both Schultz's and Benedict's parts were ultimately cut from the film proper, but placed after the credits of the theatrical showing as an easter egg.

He was the host of a conservative talk radio podcast called Howling Mad Radio, which ended in March 2009. Schultz has also guest hosted for Michael Savage on "The Savage Nation," Jerry Doyle on "The Jerry Doyle Show", and Rusty Humphries on "The Rusty Humphries Show" on numerous occasions.

Personal life

Schultz married former actress Wendy Fulton (Bare Essence) in 1983.  They have one daughter, Ava (b. 1987), who serves in the Marines. Schultz is a Christian of German descent.

Schultz is a conservative and in 2012 began regular appearances on The Glazov Gang, an internet political talk show hosted by Jamie Glazov, the managing editor of FrontPage Magazine.  He also posts political commentaries and podcasts on his official fansite.
