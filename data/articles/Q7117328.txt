Patrick Joseph "P. J." Sheehan (born 1 March 1933) is a former Irish Fine Gael politician. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Cork South-West constituency from 1981 to 2002 and 2007 to 2011.

Personal life

Sheehan is married to Frances, and they have four children.

Career

Sheehan has been involved in politics for more than 50 years. In 1967 he was elected to Cork County Council for the first time. He is a prominent campaigner for rural rights. He once clashed with Taoiseach Charles Haughey in the Dáil chamber.

Formerly an auctioneer, merchant and farmer, Sheehan was first elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1981 general election and retained his seat until losing it at the 2002 general election. He regained his seat at the 2007 general election at the age of 74. He served as Fine Gael's Deputy spokesperson on Agriculture with special responsibility for Forestry until 2010.

Drink driving incident

On 20 September 2010, he apologised after being under the influence of alcohol and threatening a garda officer after she prevented him from driving while leaving Leinster House in July 2010. He was reported to have threatened her career if she disrupted him. His party leader Enda Kenny told a sergeant to "ignore what Sheehan had said". Sheehan resigned his position as Fine Gael's Deputy spokesperson on Agriculture later on 20 September with immediate effect.

He retired from politics at the 2011 general election.
