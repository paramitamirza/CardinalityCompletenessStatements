Patricia Pearson (born April 7, 1964) is a Canadian writer and journalist. She has published three non-fiction books and two novels.

Life and work

Born in Mexico City, Pearson is one of five children of Canadian diplomat Geoffrey Pearson and former Ontario Senator Landon Pearson, and the granddaughter of former Prime Minister Lester Pearson. She was educated at Netherwood School in Rothesay, New Brunswick, Trinity College, Toronto, the University of Chicago, and Columbia School of Journalism in New York.

Pearson has written for magazines such as The New Yorker, Toronto Life, Reader's Digest and Business Week. Her newspaper work has appeared in The Globe and Mail, The Toronto Star, The New York Times, National Post, The Guardian, and The Daily Telegraph. She's also written for CBC Television, The History Channel and TVOntario.

Pearson resigned her weekly column at the National Post in 2003 to protest that newspaper's support for the Bush administration in the lead-up to the Iraq war. Her subsequent satirical writing has been hailed as "hysterically funny" by the Los Angeles Times and “highly amusing” by the New York Times.  Pearson has lived in New York, Delhi and Moscow, and now resides in Toronto, Ontario with her husband and two children.
