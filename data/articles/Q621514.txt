Film career

Upon reading a survey stating that films have become more influential than churches, Kendrick set out to change the perception of movies in mainstream America. He co-wrote (with brother Stephen Kendrick), directed and acted in all four movies Sherwood Pictures has produced. Their second film, Facing the Giants, grossed over $10 million at the box office. The football feature became the best-selling Christian DVD of 2007. His third film, Fireproof, grossed $33.5 million, making it the highest-grossing independent film of 2008. The project went on to win Best Feature at the 2009 San Antonio Independent Christian Film Festival, as well as the Epiphany Prize at the Movieguide Awards in Los Angeles. The fourth feature film by Sherwood Pictures, Courageous, distributed by TriStar, was released in theaters in September 2011 and grossed $34.5 million. The film won Best Feature Film and the Jubilee Award at the 2012 San Antonio Independent Christian Film Festival as well as the Epiphany Prize at the 2012 Movieguide Awards. Courageous was also the first winner of the K-Love Movie Impact Award (presented in 2013) and winner of the first Dove Award for Movie of the Year (also presented in 2013). Kendrick also appeared in the 2013 film The Lost Medallion and the 2014 film Moms' Night Out.

The Kendrick brothers' fifth film, War Room, was released in theaters across the United States on August 28, 2015. War Room focuses on the transformational role that prayer can play in an individualâ€™s life. The cast includes New York Times best-selling author and Bible teacher Priscilla Shirer in her film debut, along with T.C. Stallings, Alex Kendrick, comedian Michael Jr., and Karen Abercrombie. It introduces newcomer Alena Pitts as Danielle and features a cameo by renowned Bible teacher and author Beth Moore in her first acting role. Provident Films and AFFIRM films are partnering with the Kendrick Brothers to release the film in theaters. Sony Pictures is again handling distribution.
