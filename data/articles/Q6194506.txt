Background

Hansen attended grade school in Idaho Falls, then moved with his family in 1969 to Arlington, Virginia. His father, Orval Hansen, was elected to Congress in 1968 as a Republican from Idaho's 2nd district, and served three terms.

Hansen is a 1982 graduate of the College of William and Mary and earned a J.D. from the University of Idaho College of Law in 1985. While in school, Hansen worked as a ranger and naturalist in Yellowstone National Park.
