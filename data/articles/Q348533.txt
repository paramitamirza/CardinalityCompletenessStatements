Personal life

Cannon married singer Mariah Carey on April 30, 2008, at her private estate on Windermere Island in The Bahamas.

Carey gave birth to fraternal twins on their third wedding anniversary, April 30, 2011. They named their daughter Monroe (after Marilyn Monroe), and named their son Moroccan Scott, because Cannon proposed to Carey in her Moroccan-style room; Scott is Cannon's middle name and his grandmother's maiden name. Monroe, like her mother, has no middle name.

On January 4, 2012, Cannon was hospitalized after suffering from mild kidney failure. He was then hospitalized on February 17, 2012, for blood clots in his lungs. On March 5, 2012, he announced that he had been diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, lupus nephritis, which was the cause of his recent kidney problems.

On May 1, 2013, Cannon and Carey lived out a fairy-tale "Fantasy" wedding at the Disneyland Resort, where they marked their fifth wedding anniversary with a renewal of vows and celebrated their twins' second birthday.

In August 2014, Cannon confirmed after much speculation that he and Carey had separated a few months earlier. In September 2014, he Tweeted, "I love @MariahCarey and that will never change!!" Cannon also defended Carey, 44, insisting the criticism she has received in the wake of their separation is completely uncalled for. He added in a series of tweets: "What infuriates me most is to hear people slander @MariahCarey" and "I will forever be indebted to her for blessing me with our children ... I will always love her unconditionally for this and so much more. @MariahCarey is an amazing Mother and I trust her wholeheartedly."In December 2014, Cannon filed for divorce and it was finalized in April of 2015.

Charitable work

In 2011, Cannon filmed a public service announcement for Do Something encouraging teens to find a cause about which they are passionate and take action in their communities.

Since 2011, Cannon has served as the celebrity spokesperson for the National Association of Letter Carriers' annual national food drive, which is held throughout the United States on the second Saturday in May.

Controversy

Eminem

Eminem's 2009 album, Relapse, contained a track titled "Bagpipes from Baghdad", poking fun at Cannon's wife, Mariah Carey. Cannon responded via his Twitter account, while Mariah released a song and video titled "Obsessed", with lyrics and visuals aimed at Eminem.

Eminem responded with a mixtape-style track called "The Warning" in which he addressed both Cannon and Mariah, and later commented that he was finished talking about the subject.

The feud was thought to have been over until in September 2010 when Cannon responded with the song "I'm a Slick Rick", in which he takes shots at Eminem in Slick Rick's flow over the instrumental for Cali Swag District's "Teach Me How to Dougie". This was followed by a campaign via Facebook, Twitter, and his radio show proposing a boxing ring fight between Eminem and Cannon for charity.

In late September 2011, over a year after "I'm a Slick Rick" was released, Cannon took another lyrical jab at Eminem by releasing a song called "I Remember".

On October 3, 2011, Cannon released another song called "Warning (Remix)" featuring Uncle Murda, aimed at Eminem, radio host Charlamagne Tha God, and the feud between R&B singer Ray J and rapper Fabolous. The song features Cannon firing lyrical shots at Eminem and an audio clip of Eminem with Tim Westwood back in 2009 where Eminem saying: "I had no idea Nick Cannon was going to start 'wiling out' on me," referring to Cannon's then canceled Wild 'n Out television show. Cannon retorted to the clip by saying: "You said it Marshall, that's all you had to do!" and that Slim Shady is "forgiven."
