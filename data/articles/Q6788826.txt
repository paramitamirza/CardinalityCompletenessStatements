Matthew "Matt" Hullum (born September 29, 1974) is an American director, producer, writer, actor and visual effects supervisor living in Austin, Texas. He is one of five co-founders and the current chief executive officer of production company Rooster Teeth, which specializes in online content, including live action series, podcasts, animation and machinima, an art using engines from computer and video games to create films.

Career

Hullum met his production partner Burnie Burns while working at TSTV at the University of Texas at Austin. He recalled loving the creative freedom due to the lack of "gatekeepers" at the station. He would graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Film.

Alongside Burns, Hullum would direct, write and produce their first indie feature The Schedule (1997), starring his roommate Joel Heyman. He would go on to work as the Visual Effects coordinator for movies such as The Faculty and Driven and settle in Hollywood.

Hullum voices Col. Sarge in the Rooster Teeth-created machinima series Red vs. Blue, and he also produces and has directed episodes of the show. He directed the upcoming science fiction comedy film Lazer Team, the first feature length film Hullum has directed in over 18 years. Hullum co-wrote the film alongside Burnie Burns, Chris Demarais, and Josh Flanagan.

Hullum has directed three music videos for singles by the Barenaked Ladies, "Odds Are", "Did I Say That Out Loud?" and "Say What You Want".
