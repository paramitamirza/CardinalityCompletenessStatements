Shirley Margaret McKerrow OAM, née Gardini (born 18 September 1933) was the first woman to serve as federal president of an Australian political party as president of the National Party from 1981 to 1987.

McKerrow was born to Dante Gardini and Margaret (Peggy), née Kelly. She attended Genazzano Convent in Kew and Ingergowrie Homecrafts Hostel in Hawthorn before studying at the University of Melbourne. In 1955 she married John Alexander McKerrow, with whom she would have four children. She served on the central council of the Country Party from 1972 and was a junior vice-president from 1975 to 1976. In 1976 she became the first woman to serve as state president of an Australian party, becoming president of the Victorian branch of the renamed National Party and serving until 1980. In 1981 she became federal president of the National Party, again the first woman to hold this position for an Australian party; she held this position until her retirement in 1987. In 2001 she received the Centenary Medal for services to Australian politics, and in 2002 she was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia.
