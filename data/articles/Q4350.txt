Melissa Fahn (born April 28, 1973) is an American voice/stage actress and singer for anime dubs, cartoon series, Broadway and Los Angeles Theatre.

Biography

Melissa Fahn was born in New York and raised in Southern California. Her father worked in television production, providing her and her siblings with the opportunity to gain performance experience at a young age. Fahn started singing and dancing at the age of 3, later making her musical theater debut at age 12. She was privately trained in acting, dancing, and singing. She majored in dance at California State University, Long Beach but left after one year to devote her time to work and theater. While working as a receptionist, her voice caught the attention of a casting director for a new Betty Boop featurette, which led to her first voiceover role in The Betty Boop Movie Mystery.

Fahn has since voiced many cartoon and anime characters, notably Luna in Mega Man Star Force, Edward in Cowboy Bebop, Haruka in Noein, Gaz, Zim in his flashback "Parent Teacher night" in Invader Zim, and Rika Nonaka, Kristy Damon and Nene Amano in Digimon. She has performed live on stage worldwide in shows such as Hal Prince's 3hree, Gilligan's Island the Musical, Singin' in the Rain, No, No, Nanette, and the rock-operas of Vox Lumiere.

In 2007, Fahn released her debut R&B album "Avignon" which was produced by her husband, Joel Alpers.

Wicked

Fahn is a member of the ensemble in the original Broadway cast of Stephen Schwartz's musical Wicked. In March 2004, Fahn replaced Melissa Bell Chait as an understudy for Glinda after the actress suffered a stroke. She departed the show on October 31, 2004. Fahn later became an original cast member of the Los Angeles sit-down productions, performing in the ensemble and again understudying the role of Glinda before departing on December 30, 2007.

Personal Life

In 2000, Fahn met musician Joel Alpers on the set of Vox Lumiere in Los Angeles, and in 2002 they got married in Kauai, Hawaii.
